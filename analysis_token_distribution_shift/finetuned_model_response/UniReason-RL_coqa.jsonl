She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one in the bunch.

Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry. \n\n\"Don't ever do that again, Cotton!\" they all cried. \"Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!\" \n\nThen Cotton thought, \"I change my mind.

It was hard and clear, and there was something inside it. \n\nThe bottle floated above them. They wanted to open it. They wanted to see what was inside. So they caught the bottle and carried it down to the bottom of the ocean. They cracked it open on a rock. When they got it open, they found what was inside. It was a note.

A third shows what appears to be two bodies propped up, back to back, against a post in front of a military vehicle. \n\nDer Spiegel identifies the soldiers as Spc. Jeremy Morlock and Pfc. Andrew Holmes, who are both facing charges relating to the wrongful deaths of Afghan civilians. \n\nSpecifically, Holmes is charged with the premeditated deaths of three civilians, possessing a dismembered human finger, wrongfully possessing photographs of human casualties, and smoking hashish. \n\nHe is also accused of conspiring with Morlock to shoot at a civilian and then toss a grenade so it would look like the soldiers were under attack. \n\nMorlock is charged with three counts of murder. He is accused of killing one Afghan civilian in January 2010 with a grenade and rifle; killing another in May 2010 in a similar manner; and shooting a third to death in February 2010. \n\nU.S. military rules also prohibit \"taking or retaining individual souvenirs or trophies,\" which the photographs may be construed as. \n\nThe trial for the two soldiers is being conducted at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington.

The group first met on July 5, 1967 on the campus of the Ohio State University to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization. The group hired Frederick G. Kilgour, a former Yale University medical school librarian, to design the shared cataloging system. Kilgour wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time, the computer, with the oldest, the library. The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations, control costs, and increase efficiency in library management. The goal of this network and database was to bring libraries together to cooperatively keep track of the world's information to best serve researchers and scholars. The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the Alden Library at Ohio University on August 26, 1971.

They brought the spreading Plague and the Excommunication of Savonarola. \n\nBoth these events tended to arrest her incipient alienation from the Frate, and to rivet again her attachment to the man who had opened to her the new life of duty, and who seemed now to be worsted in the fight for principle against profligacy. For Romola could not carry from day to day into the abodes of pestilence and misery the sublime excitement of a gladness that, since such anguish existed, she too existed to make some of the anguish less bitter, without remembering that she owed this transcendent moral life to Fra Girolamo. She could not witness the silencing and excommunication of a man whose distinction from the great mass of the clergy lay, not in any heretical belief, not in his superstitions, but in the energy with which he sought to make the Christian life a reality, without feeling herself drawn strongly to his side. \n\nFar on in the hot days of June the Excommunication, for some weeks arrived from Rome, was solemnly published in the Duomo. Romola went to witness the scene, that the resistance it inspired might invigorate that sympathy with Savonarola which was one source of her strength. It was in memorable contrast with the scene she had been accustomed to witness there. \n\nQ: Who was excommunicated?\n\nA: Fra Girolamo\n\nQ: Was he a heretic?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: Was he superstitious?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: Why was he excommunicated then?\n\nA: unknown\n\nQ: Who was inspired by this man?\n\nA: Romola\n\nQ: Where was the Excommunication published?\n\nA: in the Duomo\n\nQ: When?\n\nA: June\n\nQ: How long was it published?\n\nA: for some weeks\n\nQ: What was Romola looking for?\n\nA: a sign from Baldassarre\n\nQ: What else was she looking for?\n\nA: sympathy with Savonarola\n\nQ: What did the summer days bring?\n\nA: Plague\n\nQ: Who was she alienated from?\n\nA: the Frate\n\nQ: Did Romola fight the plague?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "I apologize for the confusion.

Reluctantly Archie unfastened the chain from the pole, and holding the end in his hand went round with Hector to the front of the pavilion. He was resolved that if under the dog's guidance the party came close up with Bruce, he would kill the dog and then try to escape by fleetness of foot, though of this, as there were so many mounted men in the party, he had but slight hope. Led by the peasant they proceeded to the hut, which was five miles away in the hills. On reaching it Hector at once became greatly excited. He sniffed here and there, eagerly hunted up and down the cottage, then made a circuit round it, and at last, with a loud deep bay he started off with his nose to the ground, pulling so hard at the chain that Archie had difficulty in keeping up with him.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nAsuncion, Paraguay (CNN) -- Paraguay installed new top military commanders, but President Fernando Lugo, who had ordered the change in leadership, was not present for the ceremony. \n\nLugo's absence Thursday morning attracted attention given his administration's silence on the sudden change in the leadership of the country's army, air force and navy. \n\nThe president's decision to replace the top brass came a day after he publicly dismissed rumors about a military coup. \n\nBrig. Gen. Bartolome Ramon Pineda Ortiz was named as the new army commander. Brig. Gen. Hugo Gilberto Aranda Chamorro and Rear Adm. Egberto Emerito Orie Benegas took over the top posts at the air force and navy, respectively. \n\nThe announcement came from the armed forces, not the president's office. \n\nCibar Benitez, commander of the armed forces, was the only top leader to retain his post. \n\nOther changes would be forthcoming in the lower ranks, said Benitez at the swearing-in ceremony, but he denied there was any truth to talk of a coup. \n\nParaguay's history is filled with unstable transitions of power since it emerged from dictatorship in 1989. Although there hasn't been a coup since that year, there were attempted coups in 1996 and 2000, and President Raul Cubas resigned amid controversy in 1999. \n\nThe military shakeup is the third since Lugo took office. The former Catholic bishop was elected to a five-year term last year. His victory brought an end to six decades of one-party rule in Paraguay, but the honeymoon did not last long. \n\nIn April, Lugo admitted that he fathered a child while he was still a priest and that he may have fathered more. The revelation, which came as a shock to most, hurt his political image. Calls for his resignation began, and have continued as Lugo has struggled to push reforms through a majority-opposition legislature. \n\nQ: who made the announcement, the office of the president OR the the armed forces?\n\nA: the armed forces\n\nQ: of what country?\n\nA: Paraguay\n\nQ: do they have a history of unstable transitions?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: who was absent Thursday morning?\n\nA: the President\n\nQ: what leadership had been changed?\n\nA: military commanders\n\nQ: who was the new commander of the Army?\n\nA: Brig.

Salisbury Plain is noted for being the location of the Stonehenge and Avebury stone circles and other ancient landmarks, and as a training area for the British Army. The city of Salisbury is notable for its mediaeval cathedral. Important country houses open to the public include Longleat, near Warminster, and the National Trust's Stourhead, near Mere. \n\nThe county, in the 9th century written as \"Wiltunscir\", later \"Wiltonshire\", is named after the former county town of Wilton. \n\nWiltshire is notable for its pre-Roman archaeology.

Stonehenge and Avebury are perhaps the most famous Neolithic sites in the UK. \n\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries Wiltshire was at the western edge of Saxon Britain, as Cranborne Chase and the Somerset Levels prevented the advance to the west. The Battle of Bedwyn was fought in 675 between Escuin, a West Saxon nobleman who had seized the throne of Queen Saxburga, and King Wulfhere of Mercia. In 878 the Danes invaded the county.

PALGRAVE. \n\nWhen Anne Woodford began to wake from the constant thought of the grief and horror she had left at Portchester, and to feel more alive to her surroundings and less as if they were a kind of dream, in which she only mechanically took her part, one thing impressed itself on her gradually, and that was disappointment. If the previous shock had not blunted all her hopes and aspirations, perhaps she would have felt it sooner and more keenly; but she could not help realising that she had put herself into an inferior position whence there did not seem to be the promotion she had once anticipated. Her companion rockers were of an inferior grade to herself. Jane Humphreys was a harmless but silly girl, not much wiser, though less spoilt, than poor little Madam, and full of Cockney vulgarities. Education was unfashionable just then, and though Hester Bridgeman was bettor born and bred, being the daughter of an attorney in the city, she was not much better instructed, and had no pursuits except that of her own advantage. Pauline Dunord was by far the best of the three, but she seemed to live a life apart, taking very little interest in her companions or anything around her except her devotions and the bringing them over to her Church. The nursery was quite a separate establishment; there was no mingling with the guests of royalty, who were only seen in excited peeps from the window, or when solemnly introduced to the presence chamber to pay their respects to the Prince. As to books, the only secular one that Anne saw while at Whitehall was an odd volume of Parthenissa. The late King's summary of the Roman controversy was to be had in plenty, and nothing was more evident than that the only road to favour or promotion was in being thereby convinced. \n\nQ: who was Anne's companion\n\nA: rockers\n\nQ: what was the only secular book she saw while at whitehall?\n\nA: an odd volume of Parthenissa\n\nQ: what feeling impressed upon Anne?\n\nA: she had put herself into an inferior position\n\nQ: what place had she left?\n\nA: t Portchester\n\nQ: did she think her companion was superior?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: what did she leave at Portchester?\n\nA: the constant thought of the grief and horror\n\nQ: was the nursery connected or separate?\n\nA: separate\n\nQ: what was Pauline devoted to?\n\nA: her Church\n\nQ: who used a lot of Cockney vulgarities?\n\nA: Jane Humphreys\n\nQ: was she threatening?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: was she serious or silly?\n\nA: silly\n\nQ: how many rockers were there in total?\n\nA: four\n\nQ: was Heter Bridgeman one of them?\n\nA: .yes\n\nQ: who was she the daughter of?\n\nA: an attorney in the city,\n\nQ: did she have any pursuits?\n\nA: only ones that were to her advantage\n\nQ: what is the name of chapter 17?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Assistant: The name of Chapter 17 is **\"Machinations\"**."}

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nA thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives, including psychology, biology, history, sociology, education, and anthropology. Within all of these perspectives, adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles. It is a period of multiple transitions involving education, training, employment and unemployment, as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another. \n\nPuberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nA team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. \n\nTwo patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. \n\nZiad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \"We were desperate,\" said Matouk. \n\nThe UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \"We are very satisfied with the results,\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. \n\nSkaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians in transplant surgery at the Royal Liverpool. \"Funding is a problem,\" said Hammad. \"In the meantime we'll go back as volunteers to Gaza for the next couple of years to do more transplants.\" The Liverpool team's next visit is scheduled for May.\n\nQ: What is Adbelkader Hammad's job?\n\nA: doctor\n\nQ: Where does he work?\n\nA: at the Royal Liverpool hospital\n\nQ: Where is his family from?\n\nA: Palestine\n\nQ: What did he and other doctors do for the first time?\n\nA: They carried out Gaza's first organ transplants\n\nQ: On how many people?\n\nA: Two\n\nQ: What organs did they transplant?\n\nA: kidneys\n\nQ: Were they donated by strangers or family?\n\nA: family\n\nQ: What were the names of the patients?\n\nA: Mohammed Duhair and Ziad Matouk\n\nQ: How long did Mohammed's surgery take?\n\nA: six hours\n\nQ: Was it successful?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: What does Skaik hope?\n\nA: that Gaza medical teams do independent kidney transplants, and possibly other organs\n\nQ: What is an issue that complicates this?\n\nA: Funding\n\nQ: What will they do in the meantime?\n\nA: They will go back as volunteers to Gaza to do more transplants\n\nQ: When will they go next?\n\nA: May\n\nQ: When were the operations done?\n\nA: a fortnight ago\n\nQ: How long does Ziad expect to be off from work?\n\nA: less than six months\n\nQ: How old is he?\n\nA: 42\n\nQ: What about the other patient?\n\nA: 42\n\nQ: How old is Ziad's wife?\n\nA: 36\n\nQ: Was she a match?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nAssistant: It seems like you're asking a series of questions about the article I provided earlier.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nZen () is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang dynasty as Chan Buddhism. Zen school was strongly influenced by Taoism and developed as a distinct school of Chinese Buddhism. From China, Chan Buddhism spread south to Vietnam, northeast to Korea and east to Japan, where it became known as Japanese Zen. \n\nThe term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word 禪 (Chan) which traces its roots to the Indian practice of Dhyana (\"meditation\"). Zen emphasizes rigorous self-control, meditation-practice, insight into Buddha-nature, and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, especially for the benefit of others. As such, it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through zazen and interaction with an accomplished teacher. \n\nThe teachings of Zen include various sources of Mahayana thought, especially Yogachara, the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras and the Huayan school, with their emphasis on Buddha-nature, totality, and the Bodhisattva-ideal. The Prajñāpāramitā literature and, to a lesser extent, Madhyamaka have also been influential in the shaping of the \"paradoxical language\" of the Zen-tradition. \n\nThe word \"Zen\" is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word 禪 () (pinyin: \"Chán\"), which in turn is derived from the Sanskrit word \"dhyāna\" (ध्यान ), which can be approximately translated as \"absorption\" or \"meditative state\".\n\nQ: Zen is part of which religion?\n\nA: Buddhism\n\nQ: What is it a school of?\n\nA: Mahayana Buddhism\n\nQ: Where did that type come from?\n\nA: China\n\nQ: When?\n\nA: During the Tang dynasty\n\nQ: What influenced Zen?\n\nA: Taoism\n\nQ: Name a country to which it spread from China.\n\nA: Japan\n\nQ: Name something the teachings of Zen emphasizes.\n\nA: Meditation-practice\n\nQ: What else?\n\nA: Rigorous self-control\n\nQ: And what else?\n\nA: Insight into Buddha's nature\n\nQ: When should that insight be expressed?\n\nA: All the time, especially for the benefit of others.\n\nQ: Does Zen value mere knowledge of doctrine?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: What does it value instead?\n\nA: Direct understanding\n\nQ: Through what?\n\nA: Through \"zazen\" and interaction with an accomplished teacher.\n\nQ: What Chinese word does Zen trace back to?\n\nA: 禪\n\nQ: What Sanskrit word does this come from in turn?\n\nA: ध्यान\n\nQ: What is a meaning of this word?\n\nA: \"absorption\" or \"meditative state\"\n\nQ: Who practiced Dhyana?\n\nA: Indians\n\nQ: Is Zen present in Vietnam?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: What about Cambodia?\n\nA: unknown\n\nQ: What is it called in Japan?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "A: Japanese Zen\n"}

Let me count the ways ... \n\nRyan Reynolds wonders if marrying his boss, Sandra Bullock, is a good thing in \"The Proposal.\" \n\nSomething old: The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square, in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and '50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeare's 1590s? \n\nSandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual. \n\nAnd there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret's fatal flaw -- she's Canadian. (So is \"X-Men's\" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.) \n\nMargaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It's an offer the underling can't refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie's mood.) \n\nOK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be's family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue. \n\nSomething new: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America's Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she's lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe. \n\nQ: What movie is the article referring to?\n\nA: The Proposal\n\nQ: What type of film is it?\n\nA: romantic comedy\n\nQ: What comparison does the article attempt to make?\n\nA: How the elements of the comedy are like the checklist of a charming, traditional bride?\n\nQ: Who are the 2 main actors/actresses in the film?\n\nA: Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock\n\nQ: Is he the supervisor?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: Do the 2 start out liking each other?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: What is the boss's name in the film?\n\nA: Margaret,\n\nQ: Is her co-star's character named Daniel?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: What is his occupation?\n\nA: executive assistant\n\nQ: What is hers?\n\nA: book editor\n\nQ: Are they from the same country?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: Does this make the plot of the film interesting?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: Why?\n\nA: Margaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation\n\nQ: How do they plan to solve her problem?\n\nA: marrying Andrew\n\nQ: What is she trying to gain from the plan?\n\nA: a green-card\n\nQ: Where must they make a trip to before this happens?\n\nA: Alaska\n\nQ: Are they seeing anyone in particular?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: Who?\n\nA: the groom-to-be's family\n\nQ: Do the 2 continue to dislike each other?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: From what era does the author state this behavior comes from?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: What is the author's opinion of the film?\n\nA: The author seems to have a positive opinion of the film, describing it as \"charming\" and \"traditional\" and praising the chemistry between the two main actors, Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nHeight above average terrain (HAAT) (or less popularly, EHAAT, Effective Height Above Average Terrain) is a measure of how high an antenna site is above the surrounding landscape. HAAT is used extensively in FM radio and television, as it is more important than effective radiated power (ERP) in determining the range of broadcasts (VHF and UHF in particular, as they are line of sight transmissions). For international coordination, it is officially measured in meters, even by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, as Canada and Mexico have extensive border zones where stations can be received on either side of the international boundaries. Stations that want to increase above a certain HAAT must reduce their power accordingly, based on the maximum distance their station class is allowed to cover (see List of North American broadcast station classes for more information on this). \n\nThe FCC procedure to calculate HAAT is: from the proposed or actual antenna site, either 12 or 16 radials were drawn, and points at 2, 4, 6, 8, and radius along each radial were used. The entire radial graph could be rotated to achieve the best effect for the station. The altitude of the antenna site, minus the average altitude of all the specified points, is the HAAT. This can create some unusual cases, particularly in mountainous regions—it is possible to have a negative number for HAAT (the transmitter would not be located underground, but rather in a valley, with hills on both sides taller than the transmitter itself, for example).\n\nQ: What does HAAT stand for?\n\nA: It stands for Height about average terrain\n\nQ: What is a similar acronym that means the same thing?\n\nA: The less popular version, EHAAT, Effective Height Above Average Terrain\n\nQ: Can it be a negative number?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: Where does that happen?\n\nA: Usually in the mountainous regions\n\nQ: What industries is it used in?\n\nA: More commonly, FM radio and television\n\nQ: What transmission types?\n\nA: Usually VHF and UHF\n\nQ: Is it given in feet?\n\nA: NO\n\nQ: What unit is used?\n\nA: Meters\n\nQ: Why?\n\nA: So that stations can be recieved on either side of the international boundaries.\n\nQ: What is subtracted from what to find it?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "A: The altitude of the antenna site is subtracted from the average altitude of all the specified points to find the HAAT.\n"}

Except in the river valleys, trees of any size are scarce on the prairie, but the slender trunks and leafless branches were closely massed and afforded a little shelter. Outside on the open waste, the cold was almost too severe to face, and George once or twice glanced anxiously across the snowy levels, looking for some sign of Edgar, who should have joined them with the team and sledge. It was, however, difficult to see far, because a gray dimness narrowed in the horizon. George stood, dressed in snow-flecked furs, in the center of a little clearing strewn with rows of fallen trunks from which he was hewing off the branches. The work was hard; his whole body strained with each stroke of the heavy ax, but it failed to keep him warm, and the wind was growing more bitter with the approach of night. \n\n\"I don't know what can be keeping West,\" he said after a while. \"We haven't seen the mail-carrier either, and he's two hours late; but he must have had a heavy trail all the way from the settlement. I expect he'll cut out our place and make straight for Grant's. We'll have snow before long.\" \n\nThere was an empty shack not far away where, by George's consent, the mail-carrier left letters when bad weather made it desirable to shorten his round. \n\nGrierson nodded as he glanced about. The stretch of desolate white prairie had contracted since he had last noticed it, the surrounding dimness was creeping nearer in, and the ranks of poplar trunks were losing their sharpness of form.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nCHAPTER VIII. BRUCE AND THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE. \n\nThe position towards France of Edward I. made it really more desirable for him that Scotland should be independent and friendly, than half subdued and hostile to his rule. While she was hostile, England, in attacking France, always left an enemy in her rear. But Edward supposed that by clemency to all the Scottish leaders except Wallace, by giving them great appointments and trusting them fully, and by calling them to his Parliament in London, he could combine England and Scotland in affectionate union. He repaired the ruins of war in Scotland; he began to study her laws and customs; he hastily ran up for her a new constitution, and appointed his nephew, John of Brittany, as governor. But he had overlooked two facts: the Scottish clergy, from the highest to the lowest, were irreconcilably opposed to union with England; and the greatest and most warlike of the Scottish nobles, if not patriotic, were fickle and insatiably ambitious. It is hard to reckon how often Robert Bruce had turned his coat, and how often the Bishop of St Andrews had taken the oath to Edward. Both men were in Edward's favour in June 1304, but in that month they made against him a treasonable secret covenant. Through 1305 Bruce prospered in Edward's service, on February 10, 1306, Edward was conferring on him a new favour, little guessing that Bruce, after some negotiation with his old rival, the Red Comyn, had slain him (an uncle of his was also butchered) before the high altar of the Church of the Franciscans in Dumfries. Apparently Bruce had tried to enlist Comyn in his conspiracy, and had found him recalcitrant, or feared that he would be treacherous (February 10, 1306). \n\nQ: How did Edward I feel that Scotland should act?\n\nA: independent and friendly\n\nQ: as opposed to what?\n\nA: subdued and hostile\n\nQ: towards what?\n\nA: to his rule\n\nQ: who always left an enemy?\n\nA: England\n\nQ: when?\n\nA: in attacking France\n\nQ: How did Edward think it best to unite England and Scotland?\n\nA: in affectionate union\n\nQ: how did he attempt this?\n\nA: study her laws and customs\n\nQ: what else would he do?\n\nA: ran up for her a new constitution\n\nQ: did he also think great appointments and trust would help?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: who did he decide to appoint?\n\nA: his nephew\n\nQ: as what?\n\nA: as governor\n\nQ: what was his name?\n\nA: John\n\nQ: where was he from?\n\nA: Brittany\n\nQ: what fact had he forgotten?\n\nA: some were opposed to this\n\nQ: opposed to what?\n\nA: union with England\n\nQ: who was opposed?\n\nA: Scottish clergy and nobles\n\nQ: Who betrayed Edward?\n\nA: Bishop of St Andrews\n\nQ: and who else?\n\nA: Robert Bruce\n\nQ: what did they do?\n\nA: treasonable secret covenant\n\nQ: when?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\nAssistant: Edward I felt that Scotland should act **independent and friendly** towards England.

The town was named Qarth, and 100 people lived there. Marge believed that the people of Qarth would attack them if they knew they were there. Qarth used to be filled with factories when Jerry was born. By the time Jerry was a teenager, most of the factories had gone away and most of the people worked on special new machines. They ate food from the fields outside of town. Their favorite food to eat was a special kind of corn. They didn't eat meat because nobody raised any farm animals. One day when he was 11, Jerry asked his mother who his father had been. His father's name was George, and he was 2 years older than Marge. Marge looked sad and told Jerry that George had left after he was born because the people in the town didn't like him. This made Jerry very sad. He went off to his corner of the car and didn't talk to Marge again until she went to bed. After she fell asleep he wanted to go out and look for his father. He packed some food and left.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nEndemism is the ecological state of a species being unique to a defined geographic location, such as an island, nation, country or other defined zone, or habitat type; organisms that are indigenous to a place are not endemic to it if they are also found elsewhere. The extreme opposite of endemism is cosmopolitan distribution. An alternative term for a species that is endemic is precinctive, which applies to species (and subspecific categories) that are restricted to a defined geographical area. \n\nThe word \"endemic\" is from New Latin \"endēmicus\", from Greek ενδήμος, \"endēmos\", \"native\". \"Endēmos\" is formed of \"en\" meaning \"in\", and \"dēmos\" meaning \"the people\". The term \"precinctive\" has been suggested by some scientists, and was first used in botany by MacCaughey in 1917. It is the equivalent of \"endemism\". \"Precinction\" was perhaps first used by Frank and McCoy. \"Precinctive\" seems to have been coined by David Sharp when describing the Hawaiian fauna in 1900: \"I use the word precinctive in the sense of 'confined to the area under discussion' ... 'precinctive forms' means those forms that are confined to the area specified.\" That definition excludes artificial confinement of examples by humans in far-off botanical gardens or zoological parks. \n\nPhysical, climatic, and biological factors can contribute to endemism. The orange-breasted sunbird is exclusively found in the fynbos vegetation zone of southwestern South Africa. The glacier bear is found only in limited places in Southeast Alaska. Political factors can play a part if a species is protected, or actively hunted, in one jurisdiction but not another.\n\nQ: How many factors contribute to endemism?\n\nA: Three.\n\nQ: Is psychological one of those?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: What about biological?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: What are the other two?\n\nA: Physical and climatic\n\nQ: In what country is the orange breasted sunbird found?\n\nA: South Africa\n\nQ: Is it found throughout the country?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: Which region of South Africa?\n\nA: southwestern\n\nQ: And what zone?\n\nA: Fynbos vegetation zone.\n\nQ: Does the term endemic have a latin root?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: What else?\n\nA: Greek\n\nQ: What would \"en\" translate to?\n\nA: \"in\"\n\nQ: And \"demos\"?\n\nA: \"the people\"\n\nQ: What term means the same thing?\n\nA: Precinctive\n\nQ: Who first used that?\n\nA: MacCaughey\n\nQ: Was he studying animal species?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Can something be indiginous but not endemic?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: What would cause that?\n\nA: They are also found elsewhere.\n\nQ: What is its opposite?\n\nA: Cosmopolitan distribution\n\nQ: What is the definition of endemism?\n\nA: The ecological state of a species being unique to a defined geographic location\n\nQ: Give me one example of a geographic location in this sense.\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Assistant: It seems like you're asking for an example of a geographic location in the context of endemism.

Both he and Amabel sat for some time with Philip, and when she went away to write her letters, Philip began discussing a plan which had occurred to him of offering himself as chief of the constabulary force in the county where Redclyffe was situated. It was an office which would suit him very well, and opened a new hope of his marriage, and he proceeded to reckon on Lord Thorndale's interest, counting up all the magistrates he knew, and talking them over with Guy, who, however, did not know enough of his own neighbourhood to be of much use; and when he came up-stairs a little after, said he was vexed at having been so stupid.

A long line at Los Angeles International Airport's security checkpoint had kept him from getting to his gate on time. \n\nHis grandson Caden would be taken off life support in a matter of hours in Denver, Colorado, with or without his grandfather's presence, according to CNN affiliate KABC. \n\n\"I was kind of panicking because I was running late, and I really thought I wasn't going to make the flight,\" Dickinson told KABC. \n\nThat's when a pilot from Southwest Airlines stepped up and held the flight at the gate until Dickinson arrived. The pilot was standing by the air bridge waiting for him when Dickinson arrived in socks, so rushed that he just grabbed his shoes at security and ran through the terminal. \n\n\"I told him, 'Thank you so much. I can't tell you how much I appreciated that.' And he said, 'No problem.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nRichmond, Virginia (CNN) -- The Virginia governor's race, billed as the marquee battle of an otherwise anticlimactic 2013 election cycle, is shaping up to be a foregone conclusion. \n\nDemocrat Terry McAuliffe, the longtime political fixer and moneyman, hasn't trailed in a poll since May. Barring a political miracle, Republican Ken Cuccinelli will be delivering a concession speech on Tuesday evening in Richmond. \n\nIn recent cycles, the Virginia race has been a key off-year barometer of national political sentiment. Four years ago, Republican Bob McDonnell won in blowout fashion, a victory that presaged the following year's GOP midterm wave. In 2005, Democrat Tim Kaine captured the governor's mansion, tapping into anxiety about President George W. Bush's handling of the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina. \n\nNot so this year. The McAuliffe-Cuccinelli race has been defined by small-bore issues and character attacks rather than sweeping national concerns. \n\nBut despite the lack of late fireworks, there are plenty of crucial insights to be gleaned from the Virginia campaign. \n\nHere's what you need to know about this year's most important race: \n\n1. The 2012 playbook is still potent for Democrats \n\nMcAuliffe isn't exactly squeaky-clean. A longtime wheeler-dealer who has been less than forthcoming with his tax returns, \"the Macker\" has a history of eyebrow-raising business ventures that make for dangerous campaign fodder. The opposition research book on the former Democratic National Committee chairman is as thick a Virginia live oak. \n\nBut Democrats have successfully turned the race into a referendum on Cuccinelli, defining him over the summer as a right-wing zealot. A Washington Post poll last week showed that two-thirds of McAuliffe supporters said they were voting against Cuccinelli, rather than for McAuliffe. \n\nQ: What are the candidates running for?\n\nA: Governor\n\nQ: Where?\n\nA: Virginia\n\nQ: Who is the democratic candidate?\n\nA: Terry McAuliffe\n\nQ: Who is his opponent?\n\nA: Ken Cuccinelli\n\nQ: What party does he belong to?\n\nA: Republican\n\nQ: Which of them is winning?\n\nA: Democrat Terry McAuliffe\n\nQ: Has he ever fallen behind?\n\nA: He hasn't trailed since May.\n\nQ: Does the other guy plan on quitting?\n\nA: unknown\n\nQ: Will he be giving a concession speech?\n\nA: Likely.\n\nQ: When is it planned?\n\nA: Tuesday evening.\n\nQ: Where will he give the speech if he makes it?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: What is the significance of the Virginia governor's race in the context of national politics?\n\nA: Historically, the Virginia governor's race has been a key off-year barometer of national political sentiment.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nWriting articles about films for The Front Page was my first proper job. Before then I had done bits of reviewing--novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine and anything I was asked to do for the radio. That was how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for television. He hired me, but Tom was not primarily a journalist, or he would certainly have been more careful in choosing his staff. \n\nAt first, his idea was that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialized knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film and radio. There would be a weekly lunch at which we would make our choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover, though there would also be guests to make the atmosphere sociable. \n\nIt all felt like a bit of dream at that time: a new newspaper and I was one of the team. It seemed so unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally, and was pretending to employ me. Such was my lack of self-confidence. \n\nTom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but we didn't get together as planned and so everything was done by phone. It turned out, too, that the general public out there preferred to associate a reviewer with a single subject area, and so I chose film. Without Tom's initial push, though, we would hardly have come up with the present arrangement, by which I write an extended weekly piece, usually on one film. \n\nThe space I am given allows me to broaden my argument--or forces me, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing. But what is my role in the public arena? I assume that people choose what films to go to on the basis of the stars, the publicity or the director. So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? I certainly don't feel I have a responsibility to be 'right' about a movie. Nor do I think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All I have to do is put forward an argument. I'm not a judge, and nor would I want to be.\n\nQ: What was their first job?\n\nA: Writing articles about films for The Front Page\n\nQ: Who did they meet?\n\nA: editing for the front page\n\nQ: Did he hire them?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: Who hired them?\n\nA: Tom Seaton\n\nQ: Who was he?\n\nA: the first arts editor of The Front Page\n\nQ: What else had he done\n\nA: he had also written for television.\n\nQ: Was he first and foremost a journalist?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: Would there be a weekly lunch?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: Would there be guests there?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: Why?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: What did the general public prefer?\n\nA: to associate a reviewer with a single subject area\n"}

Here he lay sick many days, for the sword cut in his thigh festered so badly that at one time his life was threatened by gangrene, but, in the end, his own strength and healthy constitution, helped with Martha's simples, cured him. So soon as he was strong again, accompanied by Martin, he travelled into Leyden, which now it was safe enough for him to visit, since the Spaniards were driven from the town. \n\nHow his young heart swelled as, still limping a little and somewhat pale from recent illness, he approached the well-known house in the Bree Straat, the home that sheltered his mother and his love. Presently he would see them again, for the news had been brought to him that Lysbeth was out of danger and Elsa must still be nursing her. \n\nLysbeth he found indeed, turned into an old woman by grief and sore sickness, but Elsa he did not find. She had vanished. On the previous night she had gone out to take the air, and returned no more. What had become of her none could say.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nA One Day International (ODI) is a form of limited overs cricket, played between two teams with international status, in which each team faces a fixed number of overs, usually 50. The Cricket World Cup is played in this format. One Day International matches are also called Limited Overs Internationals (LOI), although this generic term may also refer to Twenty20 International matches. They are major matches and considered the highest standard of List A, limited overs competition. \n\nThe international one-day game is a late twentieth-century development. The first ODI was played on 5 January 1971 between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. When the first three days of the third Test were washed out officials decided to abandon the match and, instead, play a one-off one day game consisting of 40 eight-ball overs per side. Australia won the game by 5 wickets. ODIs were played in white kits with a red ball. \n\nIn the late 1970s, Kerry Packer established the rival World Series Cricket competition, and it introduced many of the features of One Day International cricket that are now commonplace, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. This led not only to Kerry Packer's Channel 9 getting the TV rights to cricket in Australia but also led to players worldwide being paid to play, and becoming international professionals, no longer needing jobs outside cricket. Matches played with coloured kits and a white ball became more commonplace over time, and the use of white flannels and a red ball in ODIs was finally abandoned in 2001.\n\nQ: How long is an ODI?\n\nA: One Day\n\nQ: What does ODI stand for?\n\nA: One Day International\n\nQ: What are they also called?\n\nA: Limited Overs Internationals\n\nQ: What does that also refer to?\n\nA: Twenty20 International matches\n\nQ: What is played in this format?\n\nA: Cricket World Cup\n\nQ: When was the ODI developed?\n\nA: late twentieth-century\n\nQ: When was the first time it was played\n\nA: 5 January 1971\n\nQ: Where?\n\nA: Melbourne Cricket Ground.\n\nQ: Was France one of the countries that played?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: Who played?\n\nA: Australia\n\nQ: Who won?\n\nA: Australia\n\nQ: Who else played?\n\nA: England\n\nQ: By how much did Australia win?\n\nA: 5 wickets\n\nQ: What are ODI played with?\n\nA: white kits with a red ball.\n\nQ: What did Kerry Packer establish?\n\nA: rival World Series Cricket competition\n\nQ: What did it introduce?\n\nA: many of the features of One Day International cricket\n\nQ: What became more commonplace over time?\n\nA: coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights\n\nQ: What led to Kerry getting TV rights?\n\nA: The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold\n\nQ: What else did it lead to?\n\nA: players worldwide being paid to play\n\nQ: When were the red balls abandoned?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "A: 2001"}

THE SUPREME SACRIFICE \n\nTHROUGH the balance of the day and all during the long night Billy Byrne swung along his lonely way, retracing the familiar steps of the journey that had brought Barbara Harding and himself to the little island in the turbulent river. \n\nJust before dawn he came to the edge of the clearing behind the dwelling of the late Oda Yorimoto. Somewhere within the silent village he was sure that the two prisoners lay. \n\nDuring the long march he had thrashed over again and again all that the success of his rash venture would mean to him. Of all those who might conceivably stand between him and the woman he loved--the woman who had just acknowledged that she loved him--these two men were the most to be feared. \n\nBilly Byrne did not for a moment believe that Anthony Harding would look with favor upon the Grand Avenue mucker as a prospective son-in-law. And then there was Mallory! He was sure that Barbara had loved this man, and now should he be restored to her as from the grave there seemed little doubt but that the old love would be aroused in the girl's breast. The truth of the matter was that Billy Byrne could not conceive the truth of the testimony of his own ears--even now he scarce dared believe that the wonderful Miss Harding loved him--him, the despised mucker! \n\nBut the depth of the man's love for the girl, and the genuineness of his new-found character were proven beyond question by the relentless severity with which he put away every thought of himself and the consequences to him in the matter he had undertaken. \n\nQ: how long did the main character travel?\n\nA: THROUGH the balance of the day and all during the long night\n\nQ: what is the main character's first name?\n\nA: Billy\n\nQ: what is his last name?\n\nA: Byrne\n\nQ: what was his profession?\n\nA: Grand Avenue mucker\n\nQ: would his prospective father and law care for that profession?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: who was his prospective father in law?\n\nA: Anthony Harding\n\nQ: and what is his daughter's name?\n\nA: Miss Harding\n\nQ: what is her first name?\n\nA: Barbara\n\nQ: who was the other guy he feared?\n\nA: Mallory\n\nQ: why is that?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Assistant: The other man Billy Byrne feared was Mallory.

A national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the \"Deutsches Reich\" was written, and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries – both left- and right-wing), as well as contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country's defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Weimar Germany fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles although it never completely met its disarmament requirements, and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan). Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border.\n\nQ: What was an unofficial designation\n\nA: the Weimar Republic\n\nQ: For what?\n\nA: the German state\n\nQ: During what year?\n\nA: between 1919 and 1933\n\nQ: Was Weimar a city?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: What took place there?\n\nA: its constitutional assembly\n\nQ: What was the official name?\n\nA: Deutsches Reich\n\nQ: When did that begin?\n\nA: 1871\n\nQ: What was adopted in 1919\n\nA: a new constitution\n\nQ: What month?\n\nA: August\n\nQ: What day?\n\nA: the 11th\n\nQ: What happened in the 14th year\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: What was an unofficial designation?\n\nA: The Weimar Republic\n"}

Much did she wish he could have such a friend as her brother would have been, and hope that nothing would prevent a friendship with her nephew. \n\nThe present question about the horse was, she thought, unfortunate, since, though Guy had exercised great self-denial, it was no wonder Philip was annoyed. Mr. Edmonstone's vexation was soon over. As soon as she had persuaded him that there had been no offence, he strove to say with a good grace, that it was very proper, and told Guy he would be a thorough book-worm and tremendous scholar, which Guy took as an excellent joke. \n\nPhilip had made up his mind to be forbearing, and to say no more about it. Laura thought this a pity, as they could thus never come to an understanding; but when she hinted it, he wore such a dignified air of not being offended, that she was much ashamed of having tried to direct one so much better able to judge. On his side Guy had no idea the trouble he had caused; so, after bestowing his thanks in a gay, off-hand way, which Philip thought the worst feature of the case, he did his best to bring Hecuba back into his mind, drive the hunters out of it, and appease the much-aggrieved William of Deloraine. \n\nQ: Who wanted a friend like her brother?\n\nA: Mrs. Edmonstone\n\nQ: Who was annoyed?\n\nA: Philip\n\nQ: Was Guy annoyed about the idea of being a bookworm?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: What did he think of it?\n\nA: Hecuba\n\nQ: Did Philip decide to keep talking about the issue?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: What did he decide?\n\nA: to be forbearing\n\nQ: Who thought they could never come to an agreement?\n\nA: Laura\n\nQ: What gave thanks in a careless manner?\n\nA: Guy\n\nQ: Who was from Deloraine?\n\nA: William\n\nQ: Did Guy understand the trouble he made?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Assistant: Let's break down the questions and answers based on the provided text:\n\n### Questions and Answers:\n\n1. **Who wanted a friend like her brother?**  \n   - **Answer:** Mrs. Edmonstone  \n   - **Explanation:** Mrs. Edmonstone wished Guy could have a friend like her brother would have been.\n\n2. **Who was annoyed?**  \n   - **Answer:** Philip  \n   - **Explanation:** Philip was annoyed about the horse, though Mrs. Edmonstone thought it unfortunate.\n\n3. **Was Guy annoyed about the idea of being a bookworm?**  \n   - **Answer:** No  \n   - **Explanation:** Guy took the idea of being a \"thorough book-worm and tremendous scholar\" as an excellent joke, indicating he was not annoyed.\n\n4. **What did he think of it?**  \n   - **Answer:** Hecuba  \n   - **Explanation:** This answer is incorrect.

With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin, while its largest conurbation is the Ruhr, with its main centres of Dortmund and Essen. The country's other major cities are Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Düsseldorf, Leipzig, Bremen, Dresden, Hannover and Nuremberg. \n\nVarious Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100 AD. During the Migration Period, the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. The German revolutions of 1848–49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights. \n\nIn 1871, Germany became a nation state when most of the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–19, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic. In 1933 the Nazi seizure of power quickly led to the establishment of Nazi Germany which was built upon a dictatorship and consequently led to World War II and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, two German states were founded: the democratic West Germany and the socialist East Germany.

The only major change of provincial borders since that time has been the sub-division of the Canary Islands into two provinces rather than one. \n\nHistorically, the provinces served mainly as transmission belts for policies enacted in Madrid, as Spain was a highly centralised state for most of its history.

If he ejects, he is wise, but the plane crashes. If he stays in the plane, he risks his life. \n\nRecently, Chinese Air Force pilot Li Feng, 38, faced this choice during a training exercise. It was March 7 and he was flying a Jian-10 (Flghter-10) at 4,500 meters. A warning appeared on the plane's computer screen. He realized the plane might fail at any moment. \n\nLi Feng did a quick check of the engine and asked the base if he could return. When the fighter was 7km away from the airport, however, the engine stopped working. The plane began to fall at a speed of 25 meters a second from an altitude of 1,160 meters. \n\nUnder Air Force rules fighter pilots may eject if their aircraft loses engine power below 2,000 meters and can't be restarted. Before Li lost contact with the control tower, the commander in the air base asked him to eject. But Li Feng insisted on having another try. \n\n\"I knew where the deadline (to abandon the aircraft) was and was prepared for the ejection, but I decided not to give up unless the fighter was totally out of control,\" Li recalled during a recent television interview. \n\nAfter 104 seconds, Li was able to bring the fighter to a safe landing. The plane only suffered slight damage. \n\n\"You are a hero! Congratulations!\" Li's teacher, Xu yongling wrote in a text message to him after the landing.

Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.

At that moment he had but one desire--to kill his successful rival, Marcus. Marcus had escaped and returned to Rome; of that there could be no doubt. He, one of the wealthiest of its patricians, had furnished the vast sum which enabled old Nehushta to buy the coveted Pearl-Maiden in the slave-ring. Then his newly acquired property had been taken to this house, where he awaited her. This then was the end of their long rivalry; for this he, Caleb, had fought, toiled, schemed and suffered. Oh! rather than such a thing should be, in that dark hour of his soul, he would have seen her cast to the foul Domitian, for Domitian, at least, she would have hated, whereas Marcus, he knew, she loved. \n\nNow there remained nothing but revenge. Revenged he must be, but how? He might dog Marcus and murder him, only then his own life would be hazarded, since he knew well the fate that awaited the foreigner, and most of all the Jew, who dared to lift his hand against a Roman noble, and if he hired others to do the work they might bear evidence against him. Now Caleb did not wish to die; life seemed the only good that he had left. Also, while he lived he might still win Miriam--after his rival had ceased to live.

Marina was more excited about getting a tattoo on her ankle to represent my fight with ALS than trying on $ 10,000 wedding gowns. \n\nMy sister, Stephanie, had arranged for a car with a wheelchair lift to drive us from the hotel to Kleinfeld. The car driver wheeled me in. \n\nAt Kleinfeld with flower arrangements ten feet high, I felt like rolling into a dream. \"Wow!\" I said. I was wearing a new black outfit. Marina wore jean shorts, a sleeveless shirt, and sneakers. _ . The kind Kleinfeld ladies pointed out rooms like tour guides, naming the designers one by one on display: Alita Grham, Pnina Tornai... With Marina walking beside me, Stephanie pushed my chair up and down rows and rows of dresses that made Princess Diana's dress look modest. \n\nMarina didn't say a word. We turned a corner into the storage room, where hundreds of dresses hung in plastic protector sleeves. Marina and I were overwhelmed. \n\n\"Want to try one on ?\" I said, touching Marina's hand. \n\n\"OK,\" Marina said in her sharp, unsure voice. \n\n\"Tell them the style you'd like.\" \n\nMarina stood silent. I felt bad for bringing her, for forcing such an adult experience on a child. \n\nMarina picked an A-line dress. Or, more precisely, the ladies of Kleinfeld picked it for her. Marina was too shocked to do more than nod. As she took the gown into the dressing room, I tried not to think of my little girl on her wedding day or of her as a baby in my arms. I tried not to think of her with her own baby in her arms one day. \n\nI tried not to think of Marina right now, embarrassed by her mother's plans, by things she could not and should not yet understand. \n\nI am leaving money in my will for Marina's wedding dress. Stephanie has promised to bring her back to Kleinfeld to purchase it. \n\n\"No pure white!\" I said to Stephanie. \"Ivory. Not too much tulle . Think lace.\" \n\n\"Think royalty when picking a dress,\" I advised Steph as we waited outside the dressing room. \"Think Princes Kate. Elegant. Think long sleeves. They make dresses more formal.\" \n\nMarina came out, sleeveless, flared . She looked like a 14-year-old girl in the middle of a giant cupcake. \n\n\"I don't like the loose gown.\" she said. \n\nThat's my girl! \n\n\"How about trying on one with long sleeves?\" I asked her. \n\nThe ladies brought out a dress with long lace sleeves, an Empire collar, a ruched fitted waist, and a long, smooth silk skirt. \n\nMarina disappeared into the dressing room. When the door opened, she looked a foot taller and a decade older. I could clearly see the beautiful woman she will be one day. I simply stared. \n\nWhat do you do when you glimpse a moment you will not live to see? \n\nI dipped my head. Breathe, I told myself. I looked up. I smiled. Marina smiled back. \n\nI worked my tongue into position to speak. \"I like it,\" I said. \n\nIn that dress, Marina stood straight, shining brightly, and tall. \n\n\"You are beautiful,\" I whispered, my tongue barely cooperating.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nParents might tell older children to \"Act your age\". But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing. While teenagers can look all grown up, studies have shown that their brains are still developing. How much this explains their behavior, though, is a subject of debate. Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health is a leader in this area of research. Doctor Giedd has been studying a group of young people since 1991. They visit him every two years for imaging tests of their brains. He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. He says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves. That includes raising the age for driving. He says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego. Mr. Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He says behavior depends for the most part on socialization. He believes that teenagers will demonstrate better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults, and are treated more like them. But is that always true? Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. He suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality. Writing in the New York Times, he says it is middle-aged adults whose behavior has worsened. In his words, if grown-ups really have superior brains, why don't we act as if we do?\n\nQ: What is a common saying that parents tell their kids?\n\nA: \"Act your age\"\n\nQ: Do scientists think it's accurate for parents to say this?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: Why do teens act immature when they appear to be grown up?\n\nA: Brain development continues into their twenties\n\nQ: What area of the brain is still growing during this time?\n\nA: the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex\n\nQ: What is its function?\n\nA: controls judgment and consideration of risk\n\nQ: What behaviors show this lack of development?\n\nA: driving too fast\n\nQ: Do all scientists agree on this topic?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: What does Epstein think plays a large role in behavior?\n\nA: socialization\n\nQ: And his occupation?\n\nA: psychologist\n\nQ: What do some think parents need to do?\n\nA: stronger control\n\nQ: Is there legislation that could help?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: What is an example?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Assistant: ### Understanding the Text\n\nFirst, I need to comprehend the overall content of the text. It discusses the idea that teenagers, despite looking grown up, still have developing brains. Researchers like Jay Giedd and Laurence Steinberg argue that certain brain regions, particularly the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex, which controls judgment and risk assessment, are not fully developed in teens. This underdevelopment might explain why teens engage in risky behaviors like speeding. However, not all scientists agree. Psychologist Robert Epstein believes that behavior is more influenced by socialization than brain development. Mike Males, on the other hand, suggests that the focus on teen immaturity might be a distraction from the fact that adults also exhibit poor behavior.\n\n### Identifying the Question\n\nThe question is: **What is a common saying that parents tell their kids?**\n\n### Locating the Relevant Information\n\nI need to find where the text mentions a common saying that parents tell their kids. Scanning the text, I come across the first sentence:\n\n> \"Parents might tell older children to 'Act your age'.\"\n\nThis seems to be the direct answer to the question.\n\n### Verifying the Answer\n\nTo ensure I'm correct, I'll check if this is indeed a common saying. The phrase \"Act your age\" is widely recognized as something parents often say to their children, especially when they expect them to behave more maturely. The text supports this by discussing the implications of this saying in the context of brain development.\n\n### Considering Other Options\n\nThe question also provides multiple-choice options:\n\n- **A: \"Act your age\"**\n- **B: yes**\n- **C: Brain development continues into their twenties**\n- **D: the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex**\n- **E: controls judgment and consideration of risk**\n- **F: driving too fast**\n- **G: no**\n- **H: socialization**\n- **I: stronger control**\n- **J: yes**\n- **K: an example?**\n- **L: an example?**\n- **M: an example?**\n- **N: an example?**\n- **O: an example?**\n- **P: an example?**\n- **Q: an example?**\n- **R: an example?**\n- **S: an example?**\n- **T: an example?**\n- **U: an example?**\n- **V: an example?**\n- **W: an example?**\n- **X: an example?**\n- **Y: an example?**\n- **Z: an example?**\n\nFrom these, only option A matches the phrase I identified earlier. The other options seem to be related to the content of the text but do not answer the specific question about a common saying.\n\n### Final Confirmation\n\nTo be thorough, I'll confirm that the other options are not relevant to the question:\n\n- **B: yes** - This is a response to a yes/no question, not a common saying.\n- **C: Brain development continues into their twenties** - This is a statement about brain development, not a saying.\n- **D: the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex** - This is a specific brain region mentioned in the text.\n- **E: controls judgment and consideration of risk** - This describes the function of a brain region.\n- **F: driving too fast** - This is an example of risky behavior.\n- **G: no** - Another yes/no response.\n- **H: socialization** - A concept discussed in the text.\n- **I: stronger control** - A suggestion made by a researcher.\n- **J: yes** - Repeated yes/no response.\n- **K to Z: an example?** - These seem to be placeholders or repeated options, not relevant to the question.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the text and the provided options, the correct answer to the question \"What is a common saying that parents tell their kids?\" is:\n\n**A: \"Act your age\"**"}

Wardman, the sheep manager, joined them at the corrals where several thousand young Shropshire rams had been assembled for inspection. \n\nThere was little need for conversation. Thayer was distinctly disappointed in this, for he felt that the purchase of ten carloads of such expensive creatures was momentous enough to merit much conversation. \n\n\"They speak for themselves,\" Dick had assured him, and turned aside to give data to Naismith for his impending article on Shropshires in California and the Northwest. \n\n\"I wouldn't advise you to bother to select them,\" Dick told Thayer ten minutes later. \"The average is all top. You could spend a week picking your ten carloads and have no higher grade than if you had taken the first to hand.\" \n\nThis cool assumption that the sale was already consummated so perturbed Thayer, that, along with the sure knowledge that he had never seen so high a quality of rams, he was nettled into changing his order to twenty carloads. \n\nAs he told Naismith, after they had regained the Big House and as they chalked their cues to finish the interrupted game: \n\n\"It's my first visit to Forrest's. He's a wizard. I've been buying in the East and importing. But those Shropshires won my judgment. You noticed I doubled my order. Those Idaho buyers will be wild for them.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\n(CNN) -- According to the \"Guinness Book of World Records,\" Sherlock Holmes is the most popular role in the movies. \n\nSo if Robert Downey Jr. hardly seems like the iconic Sherlock (he's too short and muscular, and strains to suggest the intellectual arrogance that comes so easily to the English), he can take his place alongside such oddball castings as Buster Keaton, Charlton Heston and George C. Scott. And he's ideally suited to director Guy Ritchie's purpose, which is not to dust off your grandfather's Conan Doyle, but to juice today's kids with a quirky 19th century super sleuth. \n\nWhat's fun about these movies is that the equation works both ways. \n\nYes, this Holmes is more likely to get physical than his predecessors, he's even a bit of a boor, but he's still a more cerebral action hero than we find in most blockbusters, and the period trappings (a seamless blend of CGI and location work) help this franchise stand out from the crowd of comic book adaptations. \n\nRitchie and husband-and-wife screenwriters Kieran and Michele Mulroney (\"Paper Man\") map out a fast-moving -- if ridiculously digressive -- Victorian adventure that crisscrosses Europe by horseless carriage, train, boat, and, in Sherlock's case, pony. \n\nJust down the road from 221 Baker Street they're digging a tunnel for what will become the London Underground. The Industrial Age is beginning to stretch its muscles, while a series of terrorist atrocities are gnawing at the fragile understanding between the great European powers.

Two things surprise Valori: first, the great strength, impregnable as it were, to which Neisse has been brought since he saw it last,--superlative condition of that Fortress, and of the Army itself, as it gathers daily more and more about Frankenstein here:--and then secondly, and contrariwise, the strangely neglected posture of mountainous or Upper Silesia, given up to Pandours. Quite submerged, in a manner: Margraf Karl lies quiet among them at Jagerndorf, \"eating his magazine;\" General Hautcharmoi (Winterfeld's late chief in that Wurben affair), with his small Detachment, still hovers about in those Ratibor parts, \"with the Strong Towns to fall-back upon,\" or has in effect fallen back accordingly; and nothing done to coerce the Pandours at all. While Prince Karl and Weissenfels are daily coming on, in force 100,000, their intention certain; force, say, about 100,000 regular! Very singular to Valori. \n\n\"Sire, will not you dispute the Passes, then?\" asks Valori, amazed: \"Not defend your Mountain rampart, then?\" \"MON CHER; the Mountain rampart is three or four hundred miles long; there are twelve or twenty practicable roads through it. One is kept in darkness, too; endless Pandour doggery shutting out your daylight:--ill defending such a rampart,\" answers Friedrich. \"But how, then,\" persists Valori; \"but--?\" \"One day the King answered me,\" says Valori, \"'MON AMI, if you want to get the mouse, don't shut, the trap; leave the trap open (ON LAISSE LA SOURICIERE OUVERTE)!'\" Which was a beam of light to the inquiring thought of Valori, a military man of some intelligence.

Two pronunciamientos, rudely printed and posted in the Plaza, and saluted by the fickle garrison of one hundred men, who had, however, immediately reappointed their old commander as Generalissimo under the new regime, seemed to leave nothing to be desired. A surging mob of vacant and wondering peons, bearing a singular resemblance to the wild cattle and horses which intermingled with them in blind and unceasing movement across the Plaza and up the hilly street, and seemingly as incapable of self-government, were alternately dispersed and stampeded or allowed to gather again as occasion required. Some of these heterogeneous bands were afterwards found--the revolution accomplished--gazing stupidly on the sea, or ruminating in bovine wantonness on the glacis before the Presidio. \n\nEleanor Keene, who with her countrywomen had been hurried to the refuge of the Mission, was more disturbed and excited at the prospect of meeting Hurlstone again than by any terror of the insurrection. But Hurlstone was not there, and Father Esteban received her with a coldness she could not attribute entirely to her countrymen's supposed sympathy with the insurgents. When Richard Keene, who would not leave his sister until he had seen her safe under the Mission walls, ventured at her suggestion to ask after the American recluse, Father Esteban replied dryly that, being a Christian gentleman, Hurlstone was the only one who had the boldness to seek out the American filibuster Perkins, on his own ship, and remonstrate with him for his unholy crusade.

Nominally a union of multiple equal national Soviet republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The country was a one-party state, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The Russian nation had constitutionally equal status among the many nations of the union but exerted de facto dominance in various respects. Other major urban centres were Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Alma-Ata and Novosibirsk. The Soviet Union was one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possessed the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. It was a founding permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, as well as a member of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the leading member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) and the Warsaw Pact. \n\nThe Soviet Union had its roots in the October Revolution of 1917, when the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced Tsar Nicholas II during World War I. In 1922, the Soviet Union was formed with the unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian, and Byelorussian republics. Following Lenin's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s. Stalin committed the state's ideology to Marxism–Leninism (which he created), and initiated a centrally planned economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization. During this period of totalitarian rule, Stalin imposed political paranoia; the mid-1930s Great Purge removed his opponents within and outside of the party via arbitrary arrests and persecutions of many people. Suppression of political critics, forced labor, and famines were perpetrated by Stalin; in 1933, a major famine struck Soviet Ukraine, causing the deaths of over 7 million people.\n\nQ: Who led the Bolsheviks?\n\nA: Vladimir Lenin,\n\nQ: What did they overthrow?\n\nA: Russian Provisional Government\n\nQ: Which had replaced the rule of whom?\n\nA: Tsar Nicholas II\n\nQ: When did the overthrow occur?\n\nA: 1917,\n\nQ: Who succeeded Lenin?\n\nA: Joseph Stalin\n\nQ: When?\n\nA: the mid-1920s.\n\nQ: When was the Great Purge?\n\nA: the mid-1930s\n\nQ: True or False: Stalin tolerated political criticism.\n\nA: false\n\nQ: What did he cause in 1933?\n\nA: a major famine\n\nQ: Where?\n\nA: Soviet Ukraine,\n\nQ: For how many deaths there was he basically responsible?\n\nA: f over 7 million people.\n\nQ: Did the Soviet Union have nuclear weapons?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: How many other states had them?\n\nA: four others\n\nQ: What does USSR stand for?\n\nA: Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\n\nQ: What was the Russian version of this acronym?\n\nA: СССР\n\nQ: True or False: The USSR was a two-party state.\n\nA: false\n\nQ: What party did they have?\n\nA: governed by the Communist Party\n\nQ: What was the capital of the USSR?\n\nA: Moscow\n\nQ: Name another major city of the USSR.\n\nA: Minsk\n\nQ: And another?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: And another?\n\nA: Alma-Ata\n"}

Archery was pretty much the fashion with the young ladies that year; it was a sport which Marian liked particularly, having often practised it with Edmund and Agnes, and her bow and arrows were always the first to be ready. \n\nOne day when Marian, Caroline, and Clara were shooting on the lawn at Oakworthy, Mr. and Miss Faulkner rode from High Down, came out on the lawn, and joined them. From that moment, any one could see the change that came over Marian. Instead of laughing and talking, teaching Clara, and paying only half attention to her own shooting, she now went on as if it was her sole object, and as if she had no other purpose in life. She fixed her arrows and twanged her string with a rigidity as if the target had been a deadly enemy, or her whole fate was concentrated in hitting the bull's eye; and when her arrows went straight to the mark, or at least much straighter than those of any one else, she never turned her head, or vouchsafed more than the briefest answer to the exclamations around. \n\nQ: Where did Mr Faulkner bring his mother and sisters?\\\n\nA: High Down House\n\nQ: Did the Lyddells stay in London until Parliament was finished?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: Where did the ladies go?\n\nA: into the country\n\nQ: Before the end of which month?\n\nA: June\n\nQ: Where did Mr Faulkner give parties?\n\nA: High Down House\n\nQ: Where was the family he interacted with a lot?\n\nA: Oakworthy\n\nQ: What was the fashionable sport that year/\n\nA: Archery\n\nQ: Did Marian like it?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: Who did she practice with?\n\nA: Edmund and Agnes\n\nQ: Which Shakespearean play is quoted at the start of the chapter?\n\nA: Much Ado about Nothing\n\nQ: Who was shooting on the lawn when Mr and Miss Faulkner rode down from High Down?\n\nA: Marian, Caroline, and Clara\n\nQ: Did a change come over Marian?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: Did she laugh?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: Did she teach Clara?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: What was the target like for her?\n\nA: a deadly enemy\n\nQ: Did she keep talking?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: Did she give long answers to remarks about her shooting?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: Was she interested in Mr. Faulkner?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: What was concentrated in hitting the bull's eye?\n\nA: her whole fate\n\nQ: Did her arrows go straight to the mark?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Assistant: Yes, her arrows went straight to the mark or at least much straighter than those of any one else."}

It is also the wealthiest city in India, Mumbai has the highest number of millionaires and billionaires among all cities in India. \n\nThe seven islands that came to constitute Mumbai were home to communities of fishing colonies of the Koli people. For centuries, the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea. Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement.

This chance discovery ended a 12-day search by the Library Company of Philadelphia for a historical treasure - a 120-page diary kept 190 years ago by Deborah Logan, \"a woman who knew everybody in her day,\" James Green, the librarian told the magazine American Libraries. Most of the diary is a record of big events in Philadelphia. It also includes a description of British soldiers burning Washington, D.C. in the war of 1812. She describes President James Madison on horseback as \"perfectly shaking with fear\" during the troubled days. George Washington, she writes, mistook her for the wife of a French man, and praised her excellent English. The adventure of the lost book began September 4 when Cory Luxmoore arrived from England to deliver the diary of his ancestor to the Library Company, which he and his wife considered to be the best home for the diary. Green told American Libraries he had the diary in his possession \"about five minutes\" when Luxmoore took it back because he had promised to show it to one other person. On returning to his hotel after showing the precious book to Green, Luxmoore was shocked to realize that he had left it in the taxi. Without any delay, Green began calling every taxi company in the city, with no luck. \"I've felt sick since then,\" Luxmoore told reporters.

Knowing I have traveled in the Middle East, she asked me if she should take it. I said it might be interesting in terms of cultural anthropology, but don't expect to enjoy yourself. The social and legal restrictions on women are rampant.\n\n**Assistant:** In the end, she turned it down, and one big reason was her trepidation about how she would be treated.\n\n**User:** Western women work in the notoriously misogynistic Gulf States, mostly in PR for governments and doing business with multinationals.

Ranging at its greatest extent from the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper in the west to the Indus Valley in the east, it was one of the largest empires in history, spanning 5.5 million square kilometers, and was larger than any previous empire in history. It is equally notable for its successful model of a centralised, bureaucratic administration (through satraps under the King of Kings), for building infrastructure such as road systems and a postal system, the use of an official language across its territories, and the development of civil services and a large professional army. The empire's successes inspired similar systems in later empires. It is noted in Western history as the antagonist of the Greek city-states during the Greco-Persian Wars and for the emancipation of the Jewish exiles in Babylon. \n\nBy the 7th century BC, the Persians had settled in the southwestern portion of the Iranian Plateau in the region of Persis, which came to be their . From this region, Cyrus the Great advanced to defeat the Medes, Lydia, and the Neo-Babylonian Empire, establishing the Achaemenid Empire. Alexander the Great, an avid admirer of Cyrus the Great, conquered most of the empire by 330 BC. Upon his death, most of the empire's former territory came under the rule of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Seleucid Empire, in addition to other minor territories which gained independence at that time.

When her first sister was born, Lin took turns with her mom holding the baby late into the night. \"I almost did everything that was supposed to be a parent's job, but I felt proud of myself,\" she said. Not all of Lin's classmates shared her experiences because of the family planning policy , a law that was carried out in China about forty years ago. But the situation is about to change. A new policy made on October 29 said all couples can now have two children. The new policy is expected to help raise the population of China. Recently, China has been facing an aging population and labor shortages because of the low birth rate . The two-child policy may also be the gift for every only child. Researchers found that growing up with a brother or sister can have good influence on one's mental health. \"Brothers and sisters do matter in unique ways. They give kids something that parents don't.\" Laura Walker, a professor from Beijing University, told China Daily. She noted that having a brother or a sister protects teenagers against loneliness, fear and so on. Liu Fang, 20, from Shenzhen University, has a 2-year-younger sister. When her sister disagreed with parents over choosing a college major, she helped her to communicate with parents. \"If necessary, I would always have her back,\" said Liu. \"The best part of having a sister is that you have a partner, friend and supporter throughout your life.\" But children with brothers or sisters also have to learn to understand and look after each other, said Laura.\n\nQ: According to the new policy, how many children are now allowed?\n\nA: two\n\nQ: When was it enacted?\n\nA: October 29\n\nQ: How far back was the original policy?\n\nA: about 40 years ago\n\nQ: How many children were allowed then?\n\nA: one\n\nQ: How old is Lin Xiao?\n\nA: 21\n\nQ: What does she do?\n\nA: She's a student.\n\nQ: Where?\n\nA: at Guangdong University\n\nQ: Does she have a large family?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: Who does it consist of?\n\nA: her parents, a brother and two sisters\n\nQ: Who's job did she do?\n\nA: her parent's\n\nQ: What problems are caused by the low birth rate?\n\nA: an aging population and labor shortages\n\nQ: What type of influence are siblings on mental health?\n\nA: good\n\nQ: What does Laura Walker do?\n\nA: She's a professor.\n\nQ: Where?\n\nA: at Beijing University\n\nQ: What news outlet quoted her?\n\nA: China Daily\n\nQ: What does a sibling provide protection from?\n\nA: loneliness, fear and so on\n\nQ: Who is the 20 year old girl?\n\nA: Liu Fang\n\nQ: Where does she go to school?\n\nA: Shenzhen University\n\nQ: How old is her sibling?\n\nA: two\n\nQ: Is it a girl or boy?\n\nA: a girl\n\nQ: What is the best thing about having a sister?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Assistant: ### Conversation Summary\n\n**Topic:** The Two-Child Policy in China and Its Impact on Families\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Lin Xiao's Family:**\n   - Lin Xiao, a 21-year-old student at Guangdong University, has a large family consisting of her parents, a younger brother, and two younger sisters.\n   - She took on the role of the \"big sister\" seriously, helping with childcare and other parental duties when her first sister was born.\n\n2. **Family Planning Policy:**\n   - The family planning policy, which limited families to one child, was implemented in China about 40 years ago.\n   - This policy led to many families having only one child, but it is now changing.\n\n3. **New Two-Child Policy:**\n   - A new policy, enacted on October 29, allows all couples to have two children.\n   - The policy aims to address issues such as an aging population and labor shortages caused by the low birth rate.\n\n4. **Impact on Mental Health:**\n   - Researchers, including Laura Walker from Beijing University, suggest that growing up with siblings can positively influence mental health.\n   - Siblings provide a unique role that parents cannot, offering companionship, support, and protection against loneliness and fear.\n\n5. **Liu Fang's Experience:**\n   - Liu Fang, a 20-year-old from Shenzhen University, has a 2-year-younger sister.\n   - She supports her sister in conflicts with parents and values the lifelong partnership, friendship, and support that siblings provide.\n\n6. **Challenges of Sibling Relationships:**\n   - While siblings offer many benefits, they also require learning to understand and care for each other.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe conversation discusses the shift from China's one-child policy to a new two-child policy, highlighting its potential benefits in addressing demographic challenges.

How dare you?\" screams her sister, Mercedes. \n\n\"We swore on the Bible to tell the truth and your fellow lied!\" her mother, Rosleigh Rose, booms at the prosecutors. \n\nAs her daughter is led away, Rose makes a promise: \"Schapelle, you will come home. Our government will bring you home.\" \n\nNot since Lindy Chamberlain claimed a dingo took her baby in the Outback have Australians become so caught up in a courtroom drama. Nearly nine years on from the verdict, interest remains strong enough to sustain a soon-to-be-broadcast Australian telemovie based on the case. \n\nAnd now Corby has walked out of prison -- on parole but free.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nI shall never forget the night, a few years ago, when Marion J. Douglas was a student in one of my calsses. (I have not used his real name for personal reasons. As he requested.) But here is his real story as he told it before one of our adult - education classes. He told us how tragedy had struck at his home, not once, but twice. The first time he had lost his five-old daughter, a child he adored. He and his wife thought they couldn't bear that first loss; but, as he said:\"Ten months later, God gave us another little girl and she died in five days.\" \n\nThis double \n\nwas almost too much to bear. \"I couldn't take it,\" this father told us. \"I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I couldn't rest or relax. My nerves were entirely shaken and my confidence gone.\" At last he went to doctors; one recommended sleeping pills and another recommended a trip. He tried both, but neither helped. He said:\"My body felt as if it was surrounded in a vice , and the jaws of the vice were being drawn tighter and tighter.\" The tension of grief ----if you have ever been paralyzed by sorrow, you know what he meant. \n\nBut thank God, I had one child left ----a four --year-- old son. He gave me the solution to my problem. One afternoon as I sat around feeling sorry for myself, he asked; 'Daddy, will you build a boat for me?' I was in no mood to build a boat; in fact, I was in no mood to do anything. But my son is a persistent little fellow! I had to give in. \n\nBuilding that toy boat took me about three hours. By the time it was finished, I realized that those three hours spent building that boat were first hours of mental relaxation and peace that I had had in months! I realized that it is difficult to worry while you are busy doing something that requires planning and thinking. In my case, building the boat had knocked worry out of the ring. So I determined to keep busy. \n\nThe following night, I went from room to room in the house, making a list of jobs that ought to be done. Scores of items needed to be repaired: bookcase, stair steps, storm windows, window-shades, locks, leaky taps. Amazing as it seems, in the course of two weeks I had made a list of 242 items that needed attention. \n\n\"During the last two years I have completed most of them. I am busy now that I have no time for worry.\" \n\nNo time for worry! That is exactly what Winston Churchill said when he was working eighteen hours a day at the height of the war. When he was asked if he worried about his huge responsibilities, he said :\"I am too busy. I have no time for worry.\"\n\nQ: What was the father asked to build?\n\nA: a boat\n\nQ: Who asked?\n\nA: his son\n\nQ: Are there other children in the household?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: What is his supposed name?\n\nA: Marion J.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nOnce upon a time there was a bird named Lily. She lived in a tree with her parents. One day Lily flew to her friend Molly's tree nest, but she didn't ask for her parents' permission. They were having lots of fun playing that the time passed by so fast. They played tag. They played hide and seek. They even played racing to see who could fly the fastest. Lily's parents started to get very worried when she didn't return home for dinner. They called neighbors and friends, and even called Molly but they didn't hear the phone ringing. It wasn't until Molly's mom called her down to eat that Lily saw that it was almost past dinner time. Lily told Molly she had to go home. When Lily got home her parents were crying and very upset because they thought something happened to her. Lily felt very bad for not telling her parents, and she said she would never leave without telling them again. Her parents forgave her and sent her to bed. Lily went right to sleep.\n\nQ: Where did Lily go?\n\nA: Molly's\n\nQ: Where did Lily live?\n\nA: tree nest\n\nQ: How did the time pass?\n\nA: playing\n\nQ: How many things did they play?\n\nA: three\n\nQ: Who does Lily live with?\n\nA: her parents\n\nQ: How did they feel?\n\nA: very upset\n\nQ: When did they start to worry?\n\nA: when she didn't return home for dinner\n\nQ: Who did they call?\n\nA: neighbors and friends,and Molly\n\nQ: Did Molly answer?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: What were her parents doing when she got home?\n\nA: crying\n\nQ: Why?\n\nA: because they thought something happened to lily\n\nQ: Did Lily feel bad?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: Did she stay up late?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: Where did Lily go?\n\nA: Molly's tree nest\n"}

They had heard a lot about Bob the clown, he was funny and knew a lot of balloon tricks. He always made the kids laugh and gave out small prizes to many of the children at the fair. Billy and Sandy had even heard that sometimes Bob the clown would give out free cotton candy and candy apples. They had waited all year and were so excited. They did all their chores and cleaned their rooms so they could go to the fair. When they got to the fair they were so happy to see that Bob the clown was handing out cotton candy and candy apples. Billy and Sandy waited in line and then once it was their turn Billy got a balloon in the shape of a dog and Sandy got a big bag of cotton candy.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nA couple of weeks ago, my 12-year-old daughter, Ella threatened to take my phone and break it. \"At night you'll always have your phone out and break you'll just type,\" Ella says. \"I'm ready to go to bed, and try to get you to read stories for me and you're just standing there reading your texts and texting other people,\" she adds. I came to realize that I was ignoring her as a father. \n\nElla isn't the only kid who feels this way about her parent's relationship with devices. Catherine Steiner-Adair, a psychologist at Harvard, wrote The Big Disconnect: Protecting Childhood and Family Relationships in the Digital Age. For her book, Steiner-Adair interviewed more than 1,000 kids from the ages of 4 to 18. She talked to hundreds of teachers and parents. \n\nOne of the many things that knocked my socks off, \" she says, \"was the consistency with which children -- whether they were 4 or 8 or 18 or 24-- talked about feeling exhausted and frustrated or mad trying to get their parents' attention, competing with computer screens or iPhone screens or any kind of technology.\" \n\nA couple of years ago, my daughter got a laptop for school. And because she was becoming more independent, we got her a phone. We set up rules for when she could use the device and when she'd need to put it away. We created a charging station, outside her bedroom, where she had to plug in these devices every night.

Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. \n\nAfter the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe. The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities. During the High Middle Ages, Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples, Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation, and Saint Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological field research.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nAn atoll (, , , , or ), sometimes called a coral atoll, is a ring-shaped coral reef including a coral rim that encircles a lagoon partially or completely. There may be coral islands/cays on the rim. The coral of the atoll often sits atop the rim of an extinct seamount or volcano which has eroded or subsided partially beneath the water. The lagoon forms over the volcanic crater or caldera while the higher rim remains above water or at shallow depths that permit the coral to grow and form the reefs. For the atoll to persist, continued erosion or subsidence must be at a rate slow enough to permit reef growth upwards and outwards to replace the lost height. \n\nThe word \"atoll\" comes from the Dhivehi (an Indo-Aryan language spoken on the Maldive Islands) word \"atholhu\" (Dhivehi: , ), meaning an administrative subdivision. Its first recorded use in English was in 1625 as \"atollon\" – Charles Darwin recognized its indigenous origin and coined, in his \"The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs\", the definition of atolls as \"circular groups of coral islets\" that is synonymous with \"lagoon-island\". \n\nMore modern definitions of \"atoll\" describe them as \"annular reefs enclosing a lagoon in which there are no promontories other than reefs and islets composed of reef detritus\" or \"in an exclusively morphological sense, [as] a ring-shaped ribbon reef enclosing a lagoon\".\n\nQ: what kind of coral reef is discussed?\n\nA: a coral atoll\n\nQ: what shape is it?\n\nA: a ring\n\nQ: what is another attribute?\n\nA: it encircles a lagoon\n\nQ: where is the coral?\n\nA: atop the rim\n\nQ: of what?\n\nA: an extinct seamount or volcano\n\nQ: above the water?\n\nA: partially\n\nQ: what language does atoll come from?\n\nA: Dhivehi\n\nQ: what word is it derived from?\n\nA: \"atholhu\"\n\nQ: what does that mean?\n\nA: an administrative subdivision\n\nQ: where is that language spoken?\n\nA: the Maldive Islands\n\nQ: what is a modern meaning of atoll?\n\nA: annular reefs enclosing a lagoon\n\nQ: when was it first used in English?\n\nA: in 1625\n\nQ: by who?\n\nA: Charles Darwin\n\nQ: how did he describe it?\n\nA: \"circular groups of coral islets\"\n\nQ: what is it similar to?\n\nA: \"lagoon-island\"\n\nQ: what word did he use for it?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Assistant: It seems like you're asking a series of questions about atolls and coral reefs.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nWool is the textile fiber obtained from sheep and other animals, including cashmere and mohair from goats, qiviut from muskoxen, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from camelids. Wool mainly consists of protein together with a few percent lipids. In this regard it is chemically quite distinct from the more dominant textile, cotton, which is mainly cellulose. \n\nWool is produced by follicles which are small cells located in the skin. These follicles are located in the upper layer of the skin called the epidermis and push down into the second skin layer called the dermis as the wool fibers grow. Follicles can be classed as either primary or secondary follicles. Primary follicles produce three types of fiber: kemp, medullated fibers and true wool fibers. Secondary follicles only produce true wool fibers. Medullated fibers share nearly identical characteristics to hair and are long but lack crimp and elasticity. Kemp fibers are very coarse and shed out. Wool's scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers attach to each other, so they stay together. Because of the crimp, wool fabrics have greater bulk than other textiles, and they hold air, which causes the fabric to retain heat. Wool has a high specific heat coefficient, so it impedes heat transfer in general. This effect has benefited desert peoples, as Bedouins and Tuaregs use wool clothes for insulation.\n\nQ: where are follicles located?\n\nA: In the skin.\n\nQ: what layer?\n\nA: The upper layer.\n\nQ: do follicles produce wool?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: does wool impede heat transfer?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: what desert people use wool?\n\nA: Bedouins.\n\nQ: who else?\n\nA: Tuaregs.\n\nQ: what is wool?\n\nA: The textile fiber obtained from sheep and other animals\n\nQ: what is wool from goats called?\n\nA: Mohair.\n\nQ: is wool chemically similar to cotton?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: what is cotton mainly made of?\n\nA: Cellulose.\n\nQ: can you get wool from rabbits?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: what kind?\n\nA: Angora.\n\nQ: how many types of fiber do primary follicles produce\n\nA: Three.\n\nQ: what are they?\n\nA: Kemp, medullated fibers and true wool fibers.\n\nQ: do secondary follicles produce three types as well?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: how many do they produce?\n\nA: One.\n\nQ: which type?\n\nA: True wool fibers.\n\nQ: is wool bulkier than other textiles?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: is it bad at retaining heat?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: what do the fibers hold?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "A: Air.\n"}

The consequence was, that when Lady Desmond left Hap House, he was obliged to consider himself as being at feud with the family. \n\nThe young lord he did see once again during the holidays, and even entertained him at Hap House; but the earl's pride would not give way an inch. \n\n\"Much as I like you, Owen, I cannot do anything but oppose it.

During this time life went on in a very triste manner at Desmond Court. Lady Desmond felt that she had done her duty by her daughter; but her tenderness to Clara was not increased by the fact that her foolish attachment had driven Fitzgerald from the place. As for Clara herself, she not only kept her word, but rigidly resolved to keep it. Twice she returned unopened, and without a word of notice, letters which Owen had caused to be conveyed to her hand.

Its capital city is Kiel; other notable cities are Lübeck and Flensburg. \n\nAlso known in more dated English as Sleswick-Holsatia, the Danish name is \"Slesvig-Holsten,\" the Low German name is \"Sleswig-Holsteen,\" and the North Frisian name is \"Slaswik-Holstiinj.\" Historically, the name can also refer to a larger region, containing both present-day Schleswig-Holstein and the former South Jutland County (Northern Schleswig) in Denmark. \n\nThe term \"Holstein\" derives from Old Saxon \"Holseta Land,\" (\"Holz\" and \"Holt\" mean wood in modern Standardised German and in literary English, respectively). Originally, it referred to the central of the three Saxon tribes north of the River Elbe: \"Tedmarsgoi\" (Dithmarschen), Holstein and \"Sturmarii\" (Stormarn). The area of the tribe of the Holsts was between the Stör River and Hamburg, and after Christianization, their main church was in Schenefeld. Saxon Holstein became a part of the Holy Roman Empire after Charlemagne's Saxon campaigns in the late eighth century. Since 811, the northern frontier of Holstein (and thus the Empire) was marked by the River Eider. \n\nThe term Schleswig comes from the city of Schleswig.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nThis year marks the 100thanniversary of Leo Tolstoy's death. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest novelists of all time.

Some refer to Tolstoy's disagreement with state-backed religion. Tolstoy's Christian views often _ those of the Roman Catholic church. \n\nHis great grandson, Vladimir Ilyich Tolstoy, thinks Russia's cool attitude has more to do with history and the author's positive worldview. After all, the last century was a difficult one of the country's people. The darker writings of Fyodor Dostoevsky, he says, better fit the national character. Tolstoy hopes that as Russians grow more optimistic they will rediscover one of their own national treasures. \n\n\"Tolstoy gives positive answers to the questions mankind is asking,\" he told the Guardian. \" In this sense he gives more hope.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nA police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. \n\nLaw enforcement, however, constitutes only part of policing activity. Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order. In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property.

Fortunately Felicity forgot to repeat the command, so Dan did stay in bed. Cecily carried his meals to him, and read a Henty book to him all her spare time. The Story Girl went up and told him wondrous tales; and Sara Ray brought him a pudding she had made herself. Sara's intentions were good, but the pudding-- well, Dan fed most of it to Paddy, who had curled himself up at the foot of the bed, giving the world assurance of a cat by his mellifluous purring. \n\n\"Ain't he just a great old fellow?\" said Dan. \"He knows I'm kind of sick, just as well as a human. He never pays no attention to me when I'm well.\" \n\nFelix and Peter and I were required to help Uncle Roger in some carpentering work that day, and Felicity indulged in one of the house-cleaning orgies so dear to her soul; so that it was evening before we were all free to meet in the orchard and loll on the grasses of Uncle Stephen's Walk. In August it was a place of shady sweetness, fragrant with the odour of ripening apples, full of dear, delicate shadows. Through its openings we looked afar to the blue rims of the hills and over green, old, tranquil fields, lying the sunset glow. Overhead the lacing leaves made a green, murmurous roof.

The Assembly comprises 60 members, who are known as Assembly Members, or AMs (\"Aelodau y Cynulliad\"). Since 2011, Members are elected for five-year terms under an additional members system, in which 40 AMs represent geographical constituencies elected by the plurality system, and 20 AMs represent five electoral regions using the d'Hondt method of proportional representation. \n\nThe Assembly was created by the Government of Wales Act 1998, which followed a referendum in 1997. The Assembly had no powers to initiate primary legislation until limited law-making powers were gained through the Government of Wales Act 2006. Its primary law-making powers were enhanced following a Yes vote in the referendum on 3 March 2011, making it possible for it to legislate without having to consult the UK parliament or the Secretary of State for Wales in the 20 areas that are devolved. \n\nAn appointed Council for Wales and Monmouthshire was established in 1949 to \"ensure the government is adequately informed of the impact of government activities on the general life of the people of Wales\". The council had 27 members nominated by local authorities in Wales, the University of Wales, National Eisteddfod Council and the Welsh Tourist Board. A post of Minister of Welsh Affairs was created in 1951 and the post of Secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh Office were established in 1964 leading to the abolition of the Council for Wales. The establishment of the Welsh Office effectively created the basis for the territorial governance of Wales. The Royal Commission on the Constitution (the Kilbrandon Commission) was set up in 1969 by Harold Wilson's Labour Government to investigate the possibility of devolution for Scotland and Wales. Its recommendations formed the basis of the 1974 White Paper \"Democracy and Devolution: proposals for Scotland and Wales\", which proposed the creation of a Welsh Assembly.

The Kingdom of Montenegro had united with Serbia five days previously, while the regions of Kosovo, Vojvodina and Vardar Macedonia were parts of Serbia prior to the unification. \n\nFor its first eleven years of existence, the Kingdom was officially called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, but the term \"Yugoslavia\" was its colloquial name from its origins. The official name of the state was changed to \"Kingdom of Yugoslavia\" by King Alexander I on 3 October 1929. \n\nThe state was ruled by the Serbian dynasty of Karađorđević, which previously ruled the Kingdom of Serbia under Peter I from 1903 (after the May Overthrow) onwards. Peter I became the first king of Yugoslavia until his death in 1921. He was succeeded by his son Alexander I, who had been regent for his father. He was known as \"Alexander the Unifier\" and he renamed the kingdom \"Yugoslavia\" in 1929. He was assassinated in Marseille by Vlado Chernozemski, a member of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), during his visit to France in 1934.

It has been very hard to keep our courage alight of late. The Caporetto disaster is a dreadful thing and not even Susan can extract much consolation out of the present state of affairs. The rest of us don't try. Gertrude keeps saying desperately, 'They must not get Venice--they must not get Venice,' as if by saying it often enough she can prevent them. But what is to prevent them from getting Venice I cannot see. Yet, as Susan fails not to point out, there was seemingly nothing to prevent them from getting to Paris in 1914, yet they did not get it, and she affirms they shall not get Venice either. Oh, how I hope and pray they will not--Venice the beautiful Queen of the Adriatic. Although I've never seen it I feel about it just as Byron did--I've always loved it--it has always been to me 'a fairy city of the heart.' Perhaps I caught my love of it from Walter, who worshipped it. It was always one of his dreams to see Venice. I remember we planned once--down in Rainbow Valley one evening just before the war broke out--that some time we would go together to see it and float in a gondola through its moonlit streets. \n\nQ: Which literary giant wrote about Venice?\n\nA: Byron\n\nQ: Did the the narrator ever visit the city?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: But did he feel close to it?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: How did he describe it in his own words?\n\nA: \"a fairy city of the heart\"\n\nQ: Who else was in love with the city?\n\nA: Walter\n\nQ: Did he visit it?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: Did he plan to visit it?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: With whom?\n\nA: the author\n\nQ: Was there a specific place when they planned about it?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: Which place?\n\nA: Rainbow Valley\n\nQ: When?\n\nA: just before the war broke out\n\nQ: What they would wanted to see there?\n\nA: gondolas\n\nQ: What disaster they were talking about?\n\nA: The Caporetto disaster\n\nQ: Did they feel hopeless?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: Was someone trying to conquer Venice?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: Were they successful yet?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: How about Paris?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: When it seemed they would conquer Paris?\n\nA: 1914\n\nQ: What sea is by Venice?\n\nA: Adriatic\n\nQ: What the city is called in reference to the sea?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Assistant: It seems like you're referencing a passage from a novel, possibly *Anne of Ingleside* by L.M. Montgomery, which is part of the Anne Shirley series. The passage you provided is rich with emotion and reflection, particularly about the city of Venice and the impact of the Caporetto disaster during World War I.\n\n### Key Points from the Passage:\n1. **Setting and Mood**: The passage describes a bleak November landscape in the Glen, with the Lombardy poplars standing out like golden torches amidst the grey and brown surroundings. This imagery reflects the somber mood of the characters.\n   \n2. **Characters and Their Feelings**:\n   - **Susan**: Offers a sense of hope and determination, believing that Venice will not fall.\n   - **Gertrude**: Expresses desperation and fear about the possibility of Venice being captured.\n   - **The Narrator**: Feels a deep, almost spiritual connection to Venice, likening it to \"a fairy city of the heart.\"\n\n3. **Venice**: The city is described with reverence, and the narrator shares a personal connection to it, having planned a visit with Walter (likely a significant figure in her life) before the war. Venice is portrayed as a symbol of beauty and hope, despite the grim realities of the war.\n\n4. **The Caporetto Disaster**: This refers to the Austro-Hungarian defeat at the Battle of Caporetto in 1917, a significant event in World War I. The disaster is a source of despair for the characters, who fear the loss of Venice and other places of beauty.\n\n5. **Literary Reference**: The narrator mentions Byron, the famous poet, who also had a deep love for Venice. This connection adds a layer of literary and historical significance to the city in the passage.\n\n### Questions and Answers:\n- **Which literary giant wrote about Venice?**  \n  Byron.\n\n- **Did the narrator ever visit the city?**  \n  No, she has never seen it.\n\n- **But did he feel close to it?**  \n  Yes, she feels a deep connection to it.\n\n- **How did he describe it in his own words?**  \n  \"A fairy city of the heart.\"\n\n- **Who else was in love with the city?**  \n  Walter.\n\n- **Did he visit it?**  \n  No.\n\n- **Did he plan to visit it?**  \n  Yes.\n\n- **With whom?**  \n  The author (the narrator).\n\n- **Was there a specific place when they planned about it?**  \n  Yes.\n\n- **Which place?**  \n  Rainbow Valley.\n\n- **When?**  \n  Just before the war broke out.\n\n- **What they would wanted to see there?**  \n  Gondolas.\n\n- **What disaster they were talking about?**  \n  The Caporetto disaster.\n\n- **Did they feel hopeless?**  \n  No, they try to maintain hope.\n\n- **Was someone trying to conquer Venice?**  \n  Yes.\n\n- **Were they successful yet?**  \n  No.\n\n- **How about Paris?**  \n  No, they did not get Paris in 1914 either.\n\n- **What sea is by Venice?**  \n  The Adriatic Sea.\n\n- **What is the city called in reference to the sea?**  \n  The Queen of the Adriatic.\n\nThis passage beautifully intertwines personal longing, historical events, and literary admiration, creating a poignant reflection on beauty, loss, and hope."}

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\n(CNN) -- The Supreme Court has just agreed to take on the case of Fisher v. University of Texas. Abigail Fisher, a white woman, argues that she has been a victim of the university's race-conscious admission policies; the university contends that its drive for racial and ethnic diversity is educationally enriching -- a benefit to all students. \n\nWill the ugly discourse that generally characterizes debate over racially preferential policies disappear with the wave of a magic Supreme Court wand? It seems unlikely. The issue is a cat with many more than nine lives. It arrived in the early 1970s and, despite many attacks, some of which have taken the form of amendments to state constitutions, it has survived in pretty fine fettle. \n\nThe court will have only eight justices to hear the arguments. Elena Kagan, having been involved in the case as solicitor general in the Obama administration, has bowed out of participation. Her absence, however, leaves five justices likely to express at least some degree of skepticism about the racial preferences given to non-Asian minorities in the admissions process. \n\nHas the University of Texas been enriched by academic diversity? Maybe. But equally likely is the possibility that racial double standards reinforce stereotypes about smart whites and even smarter Asians. There are certainly wide gaps in the average SAT scores between blacks and Hispanics, on the one hand, and whites and Asians, on the other hand. \n\nAmong freshmen entering the University of Texas in 2009 who did not fall into the top 10% of their high school class (automatic admission at the university), Asians scored at the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT takers nationwide, whites at the 89th percentile, Hispanics at the 80th percentile and blacks at the 52nd percentile. Startling? No. This picture has been well known for a long time. Heartbreaking, yes, because the numbers mean the underperforming minority students are being woefully ill served by the K-12 school system. Moreover, arriving at institutions of higher education with an academic disadvantage, they do not catch up, as it has become clear. \n\nQ: What does being in the top 10% of your high school class get you?\n\nA: automatic admission\n\nQ: To where?\n\nA: at the university\n\nQ: Which one?\n\nA: University of Texas\n\nQ: Where do whites rank on the SAT?\n\nA: 89th percentile\n\nQ: Asians?\n\nA: 93rd percentile\n\nQ: Hispanics\n\nA: 80th percentile\n\nQ: Blacks?\n\nA: 52nd percentile\n\nQ: What system is to blame for this difference?\n\nA: K-12 school system.\n\nQ: Who is taking their case to The Supreme Court?\n\nA: Abigail Fisher\n\nQ: Who is she suing?\n\nA: University of Texas\n\nQ: What does she feel made her a victim?\n\nA: race-conscious admission policies\n\nQ: What race is she?\n\nA: white\n\nQ: How does the university feel about their policy?\n\nA: is educationally enriching\n\nQ: How many justices will participate in this case?\n\nA: eight\n\nQ: Who's they ninth judge?\n\nA: Elena Kagan\n\nQ: What happened to her?\n\nA: bowed out\n\nQ: Was she previously involved in this case?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: During what?\n\nA: during Obama administration\n\nQ: What was her job?\n\nA: solicitor general\n\nQ: Without her how many will doubt the policy?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "A: five\n"}

But Howie Choset sees in their delicate movements a way to save lives. \n\nThe 37-year-old Carnegie Mellon University professor has spent years developing snake-like robots he hopes will eventually slide through fallen buildings in search of victims trapped after natural disasters or other emergencies. \n\nDan Kara is president of Robotics Trends, a Northboro, Mass.-based company that publishes an online industry magazine and runs robotics trade shows. He said there are other snake-like robots being developed, mainly at universities, but didn't know of one that could climb pipes. \n\nThe Carnegie Mellon machines are designed to carry cameras and electronic sensors and can be controlled with a joystick . They move smoothly with the help of small electric motors, or servos, commonly used by hobbyists in model airplanes. \n\nBuilt from lightweight materials, the robots are about the size of a human arm or smaller. They can sense which way is up, but are only as good as their human operators, Choset added. \n\nSam Stover, a search term manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency based in Indiana, said snake-type robots would offer greater mobility than equipment currently available, such as cameras attached to extendable roles. \n\n\"It just allows us to do something we've not been able to do before,\" Stover said, \"We needed them yesterday.\" \n\nHe said snifter dogs are still the best search tool for rescue workers, but that they can only be used effectively when workers have access to damaged building. \n\nStover, among the rescue workers who handled the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, said snake robots would have helped rescuers search flooded houses in that disaster. \n\nChoset said the robots may not be ready for use for another five to ten years, depending on funding.\n\nQ: Who uses snakes to save lives?\n\nA: Howie Choset\n\nQ: How old is he?\n\nA: 37\n\nQ: Does he teach?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: Where?\n\nA: Carnegie Mellon\n\nQ: What does he make?\n\nA: robots\n\nQ: Why?\n\nA: To help victims\n\nQ: What is Robotics Trends?/\n\nA: a company\n\nQ: What does it do?\n\nA: publishes an online industry magazine\n\nQ: Where is it based?\n\nA: Northboro\n\nQ: Which state?\n\nA: Massachusetts\n\nQ: Does it have a president?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: Who is it?\n\nA: Dan Kara\n\nQ: What are the machines controlled by?\n\nA: a joystick\n\nQ: Do they move smoothly?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: What are servos?\n\nA: small electric motors\n\nQ: Who else uses them?\n\nA: hobbyists\n\nQ: What are the robots built from?\n\nA: lightweight materials\n\nQ: How big are they?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: Do they know which way is up?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "A: Yes\n"}

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In 1989, the warnings were dire. The Spike Lee film \"Do the Right Thing,\" critics and columnists said, would provoke violence and disrupt race relations. \n\nSpike Lee: \"I wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time.\" \n\n\"This movie is dynamite under every seat,\" wrote Newsweek's Jack Kroll. \n\nOther commentators believed the film would harm the candidacy of David Dinkins, an African-American who was running for mayor of New York. It might even spark riots at movie theaters, they thought. \n\nInstead, what the film provoked was ... talk. There were no riots. Dinkins was elected. \"Do the Right Thing\" had a successful run at the box office -- if not as successful as Lee and his supporters hoped -- and was nominated for two Academy Awards. \n\nTwenty years later, the film still maintains a hold on the imagination. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked it as one of the 100 best American films. Roger Ebert, who has written he cried when he first saw the film at the Cannes Film Festival, still considers the film a wonder: \"Spike Lee had done an almost impossible thing.

Lee's first two films, \"She's Gotta Have It\" (1986) and \"School Daze\" (1988), had marked him as a rising young filmmaker. But it was \"Do the Right Thing,\" made when Lee was just 32, that showcased his confidence, from the deliberately striking color scheme (bright reds and oranges that make a hot day seem even hotter) to its heightened -- sometimes stagy -- atmosphere, to its grim, documentary-style riot climax. \n\nQ: Who created Do the Right Thing?\n\nA: Spike Lee\n\nQ: When?\n\nA: 1989\n\nQ: Why were newspaper writers concerned?\n\nA: they said it would provoke violence and disrupt race relations\n\nQ: Were they right?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: Was the movie successful?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: Was it nominated for any awards?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: Which one?\n\nA: two Academy Awards.\n\nQ: Who called the film a wonder?\n\nA: Roger Ebert\n\nQ: When did he see it first?\n\nA: at the Cannes Film Festival\n\nQ: What over movies did Lee make?\n\nA: \"She's Gotta Have It\" and \"School Daze\"\n\nQ: How old was he when he made Do the Right Thing?\n\nA: 32\n\nQ: Who was campaigning for mayor?\n\nA: David Dinkins\n\nQ: Of what city?\n\nA: New York\n\nQ: What group ranked it as one of the best?\n\nA: the American Film Institute\n\nQ: When?\n\nA: In 2007\n\nQ: Did Ebert laugh when he saw it?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "A: No, Roger Ebert cried when he first saw the film at the Cannes Film Festival.\n"}

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nClimate is the statistics of weather over long periods of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. \n\nA region's climate is generated by the climate system, which has five components: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. \n\nThe climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents. Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the Köppen climate classification. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region. \n\nPaleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores, and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral. Climate models are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in global warming. Global warming results in redistributions. For example, \"a 3°C change in mean annual temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300–400 km in latitude (in the temperate zone) or 500 m in elevation.

Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as the gene–environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life. \n\nGenes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population. These alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, which cause different phenotype traits. Colloquial usage of the term \"having a gene\" (e.g., \"good genes,\" \"hair colour gene\") typically refers to having a different allele of the gene. Genes evolve due to natural selection or survival of the fittest of the alleles.\n\nQ: do genes evolve?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: what are polygenes?\n\nA: many different genes\n\nQ: are all genetic traits visible?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: can genes mutate?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: what are different variants of genes called?\n\nA: alleles\n\nQ: how many specific genetic traits are named?\n\nA: Five\n\nQ: what is a locus also called?\n\nA: Region\n\nQ: is eye color visible?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: is blood type visible?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: are genes related to DNA?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: what is a gene?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "A gene is a specific sequence of nucleotides in DNA or RNA that encodes a functional product, such as a protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the fundamental units of heredity, meaning they are responsible for passing traits from parents to offspring. They are located at specific positions, called loci (singular: locus), on chromosomes. Genes can vary in sequence, leading to different versions known as alleles, which can result in different traits or characteristics.

He allowed the girls to print his name as editor in chief, but he did no editorial work at all, amusing himself these delightful summer days by wandering in the woods, where he collected botanical specimens, or sitting with Uncle John on the lawn, where they read together or played chess.

The two girls found plenty to occupy them at the office, while Louise did the reportorial work and flitted through Millville and down to Huntingdon each day in search of small items of local interest.

It recognises distinguished personal service to the monarch of the Commonwealth realms, members of the monarch's family, or to any viceroy or senior representative of the monarch. The present monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, is the Sovereign of the order, its motto is \"Victoria\", and its official day is 20 June. The order's chapel is the Savoy Chapel in London. \n\nThere are no limits on the number honoured, and admission remains at the sole discretion of the monarch, with each of the order's five grades and one medal with three levels representing different levels of service. While all those honoured may use the prescribed styles of the order—the top two grades grant titles of knighthood, and all grades accord distinct post-nominal letters—the Royal Victorian Order's precedence amongst other honours differs from realm to realm and admission to some grades may be barred to citizens of those realms by government policy. \n\nPrior to the close of the 19th century, most general honours within the British Empire were bestowed by the sovereign on the advice of her British ministers, who sometimes forwarded advice from ministers of the Crown in the Dominions and colonies (appointments to the then most senior orders of chivalry—the Most Noble Order of the Garter and the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle—had been made on ministerial advice since the 18th century and were not restored to the personal gift of the sovereign until 1946 and 1947, respectively). Queen Victoria thus established on 21 April 1896 the Royal Victorian Order as a junior and personal order of knighthood that allowed her to bestow directly to an empire-wide community honours for personal services. The organisation was founded a year preceding Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, so as to give the Queen time to complete a list of first inductees.

Zimmerman's attorneys have decided they will try this as a self-defense case. \n\nFlorida's deadly force law, also called \"stand your ground\", was passed in 2005. It allows people to meet \"force with force\" if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant. Under the law, a person can use deadly force anywhere as long as he is not engaged in an unlawful activity, is being attacked in a place he has a right to be, and reasonably believes that his life and safety are in danger as a result of an overt act or perceived threat committed by someone else. \n\nIn a pretrial immunity hearing, a judge would have ruled whether Zimmerman's actions were protected under the \"stand your ground\" law; a ruling in favor of the defendant would have meant that no criminal or civil trial could proceed. \n\nMartin was shot and killed on February 26, 2012, while returning from a nearby convenience store to his father's fiancée's house in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. \n\nZimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, acknowledged that he shot the unarmed 17-year-old, but said Martin physically attacked him and he fired in self-defense.

The paper includes a daily religious feature on \"The Home Forum\" page, but states the publication is not a platform for evangelizing. \n\nIn 2008 the \"Monitor\" discontinued its daily print version to focus on web-based publishing, replacing its daily print edition with a weekly news magazine with an international focus. Mark Sappenfield became the editor in March of 2017. \n\nDespite its name, the \"Monitor\" does not claim to be a religious-themed paper, and says it does not promote the doctrine of its patron church. However, at its founder Eddy's request, a daily religious article has appeared in every issue of the \"Monitor\". Eddy also required the inclusion of \"Christian Science\" in the paper's name, over initial opposition by some of her advisors who thought the religious reference might repel a secular audience. \n\nThe \"Monitor\"'s inception was, in part, a response by Eddy to the journalism of her day, which relentlessly covered the sensations and scandals surrounding her new religion with varying degrees of accuracy.

In his free time, he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly. He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true. For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying.

The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react. He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings. Oink's dream was finally coming true. He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held. Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also. He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm.

But in recent months, even China's breakneck economic pace has hit some speed bumps. \n\nOn the broader geopolitical front, Rudd wants China and the United States to carve out a new Asia-Pacific \"strategic road-map\" that will enhance trade, investment and security in the region. \n\nREAD MORE: Rudd: Better second time around? \n\nThe Opposition's view on China \n\nAbbott, who has led the opposition Liberal Party since 2009, wants the Australia-China relationship to move from one based on shared interests to one of \"shared values.\" \n\nBut he notes that Australia's friendship with China is more recent than that with Japan, and less developed than that with the United States. \n\nIn a major policy speech to a business audience in Beijing last year, Abbott said he believed it would take time before Australia's ties with China approached \"the warmth that we take for granted with America.\" Still, he believes it is an effort worth making. \n\nLike his mentor, former Australian prime minister John Howard, Abbott is a rock-solid supporter of Australia's military alliance with the United States, and believes that it is possible to be friends both with Washington and Beijing.

At 15 weeks old, she was nearly made to leave the Petsmart Training School. She spent every night lying in our bed-snoring so loudly that I hardly got a good night's sleep. Then, about six months after she arrived, I felt that something in my heart was taking place, and I was unable to stop it. My behaviour began to change. I began to smile at people when passing them in a street. I returned from neighbours. I started calling my kids, and to my surprise, they started calling me. I even tried to speak to my grandchildren over the phone once. I even was glad to listen to laughter from a 10-month-old granddaughter. The point is that I was changing.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nA social class (or, simply, class), as in class society, is a set of subjectively defined concepts in the social sciences and political theory centered on models of social stratification in which people are grouped into a set of hierarchical social categories, the most common being the upper, middle, and lower classes. \n\nClass is a subject of analysis for sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, and social historians. However, there is not a consensus on a definition of \"class\", and the term has a wide range of sometimes conflicting meanings. In common parlance, the term \"social class\" is usually synonymous with \"socio-economic class\", defined as \"people having the same social, economic, cultural, political or educational status\", e.g., \"the working class\"; \"an emerging professional class\". However, academics distinguish social class and socioeconomic status, with the former referring to one’s relatively stable sociocultural background and the latter referring to one’s current social and economic situation and, consequently, being more changeable over time. \n\nThe precise measurements of what determines social class in society has varied over time. Karl Marx thought \"class\" was defined by one's relationship to the means of production (their relations of production). His simple understanding of classes in modern capitalist society, are the proletariat, those who work but do not own the means of production; and the bourgeoisie, those who invest and live off of the surplus generated by the former. This contrasts with the view of the sociologist Max Weber, who argued \"class\" is determined by economic position, in contrast to \"social status\" or \"\"Stand\"\" which is determined by social prestige rather than simply just relations of production.\n\nQ: What is one group that analyzes classes?\n\nA: sociologists\n\nQ: Ad another?\n\nA: political scientists\n\nQ: And one more?\n\nA: anthropologists\n\nQ: Does everyone agree on what class means?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: Which two terms are generally the same in common usage?\n\nA: \"social class\" and \"socio-economic class\"\n\nQ: Do scholars think they are the same?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: True or False: Scholars consider social class to be more changeable than the other term.\n\nA: False\n\nQ: What are the three most common class groupings?\n\nA: unknown\n\nQ: By what relationship did Marx define class?\n\nA: the means of production\n\nQ: Which group did not own that means?\n\nA: proletariat\n\nQ: What is the other group called?\n\nA: bourgeoisie\n\nQ: What did they live off?\n\nA: surplus generated by the former\n\nQ: What kind of society did Mark see these classes in?\n\nA: modern capitalist society\n\nQ: Was his theory very complex?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: Did Weber have the same ideas?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: What did Weber think class was decided by?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: What did Weber think class was decided by?\n\nA: economic position\n"}

The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. \n\nDuring the War of Independence the main cities and their surrounding countrysides became provinces though the intervention of their \"cabildos\". The Anarchy of the Year XX completed this process, shaping the original thirteen provinces. Jujuy seceded from Salta in 1834, and the thirteen provinces became fourteen. After seceding for a decade, Buenos Aires Province accepted the 1853 Constitution of Argentina in 1861, and its capital city was made a federal territory in 1880. \n\nA law from 1862 designated as national territories those under federal control but outside the frontiers of the provinces. In 1884 they served as bases for the establishment of the governorates of Misiones, Formosa, Chaco, La Pampa, Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego. The agreement about a frontier dispute with Chile in 1900 created the National Territory of Los Andes; its lands were incorporated into Jujuy, Salta and Catamarca in 1943. La Pampa and Chaco became provinces in 1951. Misiones did so in 1953, and Formosa, Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz, in 1955.

Rather than read, the kid really preferred running around with an 8mm camera, shooting homemade movies, which he showed to friends for a small fee. \n\nIn his first year of high school, he dropped out. But when his parents persuaded him to return, he was mistakenly placed in a learningdisabled class, which lasted one month. Only when the family moved to another town did he land up in a more suitable high school, where he eventually graduated. \n\nAfter being denied entrance into a traditional filmmaking school, Steven Spielherg enrolled in English at California State University at Long Beach. Then in 1965, he recalls, in one of those serendipitous moments, his life took a complete turn. Visiting Universal Studios, he met Chuck Silvers, an executive in the editorial department. Silvers liked the kid who made 8mm films and invited him back sometime to visit. \n\nHe appeared the next day. Spielberg, dressed in a dark suit, carrying his father's briefcase with nothing inside but a sandwich and candy bars walked confidently up to the guard at the gate of Universal and gave him a casual wave. The guard waved back. He was in. \n\n\"For the entire summer,\" Spielberg remembers, \"I dressed in my suit and hung out with the directors and writers, including Silvers, who knew the kid wasn't a studio employee, but winked at him.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nMost people know precious gemstones by their appearances. An emerald flashes deep green, a ruby seems to hold a red fire inside, and a diamond shines like a star. It's more difficult to tell where the gem was mined, since a diamond from Australia or Arkansas may appear the same to one from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, recently, a team of scientists has found a way to identify a gemstone's origin. \n\nBeneath the surface of a gemstone, on the tiny level of atoms and molecules , lie clues to its origin. At this year's meeting of the Geological Society of America in Minneapolis, Catherine McManus reported on a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland. McManus directs scientific research at Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas. The company is developing the technique. \"With enough data, we could identify which country, which mining place, even the individual mine a gemstone comes from,\" McManus told Science News. \n\nSome gemstones, including many diamonds, come from war-torn countries. Sales of those \"blood minerals\" may encourage violent civil wars where innocent people are injured or killed. In an effort to reduce the trade in blood minerals, the U.S. government passed law in July 2010 that requires companies that sell gemstones to determine the origins of their stones. \n\nTo figure out where gemstones come from, McManus and her team focus a powerful laser on a small sample of the gemstone. The technique is called laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. Just as heat can turn ice into water or water into steam, energy from the laser changes the state of matter of the stone. The laser changes a miniscule part of the gemstone into plasma, a gas state of matter in which tiny particles called electrons separate from atoms. \n\nThe plasma, which is superhot, produces a light pattern. (The science of analyzing this kind of light pattern is called spectroscopy.) Different elements produce different patterns, but McManus and her team say that gemstones from the same area produce similar patterns. Materialytics has already collected patterns from thousands of gemstones, including more than 200 from diamonds. They can compare the light pattern from an unknown gemstone to patterns they do know and look for a match. The light pattern acts like a signature, telling the researchers the origin of the gemstone. \n\nIn a small test, the laser technique correctly identified the origins of 95 out of every 100 diamonds. For gemstones like emeralds and rubies, the technique proved successful for 98 out of every 100 stones. The scientists need to collect and analyze more samples, including those from war-torn countries, before the tool is ready for commercial use. \n\nScientists like Barbara Dutrow, a mineralogist from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, find the technique exciting. \"This is a basic new tool that could provide a better fingerprint of a material from a particular locality,\" she told Science News.\n\nQ: Has a team of scientists found a way to identify a gemstone's origin?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: Where  lie clues to a gemstone's origin?\n\nA: Beneath the surface of a gemstone\n\nQ: Who reported on a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues?\n\nA: Catherine McManus\n\nQ: Where?\n\nA: At the Geological Society of America\n\nQ: in what city?\n\nA: Minneapolis\n\nQ: What is McManus' job?\n\nA: Director of Scientific Research\n\nQ: for which company?\n\nA: Materialytics\n\nQ: located where?\n\nA: in Killeen\n\nQ: in which state?\n\nA: Texas\n\nQ: Do many diamonds come from war-torn countries?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: What happens to innocent people in those countries?\n\nA: injured\n\nQ: What else?\n\nA: killed\n\nQ: What did the US government do to stop this?\n\nA: Passed a law\n\nQ: What did the law do?\n\nA: Requires companies that sell gemstones to determine the origins of their stones\n\nQ: How does McManus determine where a gemstone came from?\n\nA: With a laser\n\nQ: What is the process called?\n\nA: spectroscopy\n\nQ: What does the laser change a part of the gemstone to?\n\nA: plasma\n\nQ: What is that?\n\nA: a gas state of matter\n\nQ: Is the plasma supercold?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: What does the plasma produce?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "A: A light pattern\n"}

For this purpose Ofcom established a telephone numbering plan, known as the \"National Telephone Numbering Plan\", which is the system for assigning telephone numbers to subscriber stations. Since 28 April 2001, almost all geographic numbers and most non-geographic numbers have 9 or 10 national (significant) numbers after the \"0\" trunk code. All mobile telephone numbers have 10 national (significant) numbers after the \"0\" trunk code. The overall structure of the UK's National Numbering Plan is: A short sample of geographic numbers, set out in the officially approved (Ofcom) number groups: In the United Kingdom, area codes are two, three, four, or, rarely, five digits long (after the initial zero). Regions with shorter area codes, typically large cities, permit the allocation of more telephone numbers as the local number portion has more digits. Local customer numbers are four to eight figures long. The total number of digits is ten, but in a very few areas the total may be nine digits (after the initial zero).

But he felt that he simply had got to speak his mind to someone, so he swam across to where he had seen Peter Rabbit almost every night since Paddy began to build.

It really is a very fine foundation, Peter; it really is. But what I can't understand is what Paddy is thinking of by building that great pile of mud right in the middle.

But the closeness of their friendship might be seen best in a story told by one of Roosevelt's close advisors,Harry Hopkins. Hopkins remembered how Churchill was visiting Roosevelt at the White House one day. Roosevelt went into Churchill's room in the morning to say hello. But the president was shocked to see Churchill coming from the washing room with no clothes at all. Roosevelt immediately apologized to the British leader for seeing him naked. But Churchill reportedly said: \"The Prime Minister of Great Britain has nothing to hide from the president of the United States.\" And then both men laughed. \n\nThe United States and Great Britain were only two of several nations that joined together in the war to resist Hitler and his Allies. In January,1942,twentysix of these nations signed an agreement promising to fight for peace,religious freedom,human rights,and justice. The three major Allies,however,were the most important for the war effort: the United States,Britain,and the Soviet Union.

Vajrayana, a body of teachings attributed to Indian siddhas, may be viewed as a third branch or merely a part of Mahayana. Theravada has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.

It's the latest in a series of unusually public squabbles between Ahmadinejad and allies of Khamenei, the Islamic republic's clerical leader, in recent weeks. \n\nKhamenei backed Ahmadinejad through the tumult that followed his hotly disputed 2009 re-election, urging Iranians to accept the results of the balloting when protesters in the streets declared it a fraud.

But the book lived up to expectations, selling some 200,000 copies and landing on The New York Times' list of Best Books of 2006. \n\nSeven years later, \"Night Film\" is hitting bookstores this week amid greater expectations and even more hype. Movie rights are already spoken for by Chernin Entertainment, the studio behind \"Oblivion\" and \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,\" and critics are raving about Pessl's multimedia storytelling approach, which takes readers beyond the novel's pages to explore the story of a mysterious director and the washed-up reporter out to expose him. \n\nPessl's fictional mash-up of Stanley Kubrick, Roman Polanski and David Lynch hasn't been seen in public for 30 years. His movies are so frightening no theater will show them; his cult of fans meet in abandoned buildings and underground tunnels for secret screenings. \n\nInvestigative journalist Scott McGrath tried to expose Cordova years ago and it backfired, costing him his job, marriage and reputation. When Cordova's daughter turns up dead in an apparent suicide, McGrath sees an opportunity to exact revenge against the man he blames for his downfall. \n\nPessl weaves into the narrative excerpts from magazine articles, newspaper headlines, police reports, crime scene photos and screen shots of online message boards.

The men had guns in their hands, and were got up with all proper sporting appurtenances, but it so turned out that they did not reach the stubble-fields on the farther side of the road until after luncheon. And may it not be fairly doubted whether croquet is not as good as shooting when a man is in love? \n\nIt will be said that Bernard Dale was not in love; but they who bring such accusation against him, will bring it falsely. He was in love with his cousin Bell according to his manner and fashion. It was not his nature to love Bell as John Eames loved Lily; but then neither would his nature bring him into such a trouble as that which the charms of Amelia Roper had brought upon the poor clerk from the Income-tax Office. Johnny was susceptible, as the word goes; whereas Captain Dale was a man who had his feelings well under control. He was not one to make a fool of himself about a girl, or to die of a broken heart; but, nevertheless, he would probably love his wife when he got a wife, and would be a careful father to his children. \n\nQ: Would people claim bernard wasn't in love?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: was it true?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: Lily left her romantic partner where?\n\nA: in the garden\n\nQ: what did she want him to do?\n\nA: to attend upon her\n\nQ: what relation to him was Bernard's love?\n\nA: doubting\n\nQ: Was bernard's partner related to him?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: how?\n\nA: cousin\n\nQ: Did Liliy's man do as instructed?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: who was he with?\n\nA: Bernard\n\nQ: any other companions?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Assistant: It seems like you're referencing a passage from a story, possibly a novel, and asking questions about the characters and their relationships.

He obeyed and appeared on Mrs. Dale's lawn after breakfast, accompanied by Bernard and two dogs.\n\n2. **Bernard Dale**: It is mentioned that Bernard Dale was not in love in the same way John Eames was in love with Lily.

Bernard is described as a man who controls his feelings and is not prone to making a fool of himself or dying of a broken heart.\n\n3. **Lily's lover**: The text does not explicitly name Lily's lover, but it is clear that he is John Eames, as he is referred to as \"Johnny\" in the passage.\n\n4. **Bernard's love**: Bernard is in love with his cousin Bell, but his feelings are more subdued and controlled compared to John Eames' intense love for Lily.\n\n5. **Lily's lover's actions**: Yes, Lily's lover (John Eames) did as instructed and appeared on Mrs. Dale's lawn after breakfast.\n\n6. **Companions**: John Eames was accompanied by Bernard and two dogs when he went to the stubble-fields.\n\n7. **Bernard's partner**: Bernard's love interest is his cousin Bell.\n\n8. **Lily's lover's name**: The text refers to Lily's lover as \"Johnny,\" which is likely a nickname for John Eames.\n\nIf you have more specific questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"}

She was THE child star--the sweet little girl whose shining smile helped _ some of the darkest days the US has known during the Great Depression. \n\nIt's hard today to imagine the super star Shirley was once \"America's Little Darling\". She sang and danced her way to the top of the box office in such films as Bright Eyes, Curly Top and Heidi. By 1940, she had appeared in 43 films. Temple teamed with Bill Robison in four movies, and their dance on the stairs in The Little Colonel is still a legendary film moment. \n\nIn the 1930s, her name on a movie introduction assured a packed house. She inspired dolls, dresses, dishes--even a drink (alcohol-free, of course). \n\nUS President Franklin D. Roosevelt once famously said that \"as long as our country has Shirley Temple, we will be all right.'' \n\nUnlike so many of today's child stars, Temple didn't end up with her name appearing across the headlines for bad behaviors. Instead of getting her photos on front pages or struggling with drugs and alcohol, Temple went on to a second career in diplomacy , including presidential appointments as ambassador to Ghana. \n\nShe surprised a lot of people who doubted her with her grace, knowledge and eagerness to serve. In fact, her career in public service (20 years) was longer than her career in movies (19). The role she valued most, however, was as wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. \n\nThe world has lost a treasured Hollywood legend.

They met with no special adventures by the way, except that when they reached the great pine-tree, Phonny proposed to climb up, for the purpose of examining a small bunch which he saw upon one of the branches, which he thought was a bird's nest. It was the same pine-tree that marked the place at which a road branched off into the woods, where Mary Bell had lost her way, several years before. Malleville was very unwilling to have Phonny climb up upon such a high tree, but Phonny himself was very desirous to make the attempt. There was a log fence at the foot of the tree, and the distance was not very great from the uppermost log of the fence, to the lowermost branch of the tree. So Phonny thought that he could get up without any difficulty. \n\nMalleville was afraid to have him try, and she said that if he did, he would be acting just as foolish as the boy that Beechnut had told them about, who nipped his own nose; and that she should not stop to see him do any such foolishness.

He was in custody in the killing of barista Samantha Koenig, 18, whom he abducted from a coffee stand in Anchorage, Alaska, last February. Koenig was one of at least eight people Keyes admitted to killing, but he may have taken other lives, police have said. \n\nKeyes' notes were released by the FBI on Wednesday after they were cleaned up at the bureau's lab in Quantico, Virginia. They were found under his body, written in a combination of pencil and ink on a yellow legal pad, the FBI said in a statement. \n\nThe bureau said the notes don't confirm any of his killings, add any new victims to his grisly toll, or offer any other clues that might help their investigation. It said an analysis showed no hidden messages or code in the four pages. \n\nBut a read of them does give a glimpse into Keyes' mind, apparently describing how it felt to take a life and the disdain in which he held much of American society. \n\n\"I looked in your eyes, they were so dark, warm and trusting as though you had not a worry or care.

It's about a tragic incident in Las Vegas involving Tammy Meyers and Erich Nowsch. Here's a summary of the key points:\n\n- **Tammy Meyers and Erich Nowsch** were neighbors.\n- They lived close to each other and a park.\n- Tammy Meyers used to talk to Nowsch in the park, encouraging him to act like an adult.\n- Nowsch was arrested for allegedly killing Tammy Meyers in a road rage incident.\n- The incident occurred a week ago in front of Tammy's home.\n- Nowsch faces three felony charges: murder, attempted murder, and unlawful discharge of a gun from a vehicle.\n- A court hearing is scheduled for Monday.\n- Tammy Meyers tried to help Nowsch by consoling him, feeding him, and giving him money.\n- Police are looking for at least one more suspect but believe Nowsch was the shooter.\n- Nowsch owns registered firearms, but the exact number and type are unknown.\n- It's unclear if Nowsch has an attorney at the time of the article.\n\n### Identifying the Question\n\nThe question is: **\"What is the main idea of the article?\"**\n\n### Defining the Main Idea\n\nThe main idea of an article is the central point or the most important information it conveys. It summarizes the overall message without going into specific details.\n\n### Breaking Down the Article\n\nTo find the main idea, I'll identify the key elements:\n\n1. **Characters Involved**: Tammy Meyers and Erich Nowsch.\n2. **Location**: Las Vegas, specifically their neighborhood and a nearby park.\n3. **Incident**: A road rage incident leading to Tammy Meyers' death.\n4. **Arrest**: Erich Nowsch was arrested for the murder.\n5. **Charges**: Three felony charges against Nowsch.\n6. **Tammy's Actions**: She tried to help Nowsch by consoling and providing for him.\n7. **Police Investigation**: Looking for additional suspects; Nowsch owns registered firearms.\n8. **Legal Status**: A court hearing is scheduled; Nowsch's attorney status is unclear.\n\n### Synthesizing the Information\n\nThe article primarily focuses on the arrest of Erich Nowsch for the murder of his neighbor, Tammy Meyers, in a road rage incident. It also highlights Tammy's efforts to help Nowsch and the ongoing police investigation.\n\n### Formulating the Main Idea\n\nConsidering the above, the main idea seems to be the arrest of Erich Nowsch for the murder of Tammy Meyers in a road rage incident, with additional context about Tammy's attempts to assist Nowsch and the legal proceedings.\n\n### Refining the Main Idea\n\nTo make it more concise and clear:\n\n- The article reports the arrest of a young man for the murder of his neighbor in a road rage incident, with details about the victim's efforts to help the suspect and the legal charges against him.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nAfter careful consideration, the main idea of the article is:\n\n**\"A young man, Erich Nowsch, was arrested for the murder of his neighbor, Tammy Meyers, in a road rage incident, with the victim having previously tried to help the suspect.\"**\n\nHowever, to make it even more precise and concise:\n\n**\"The article details the arrest of Erich Nowsch for the murder of his neighbor, Tammy Meyers, in a road rage incident, highlighting the victim's prior attempts to assist the suspect.\"**\n\nBut perhaps a simpler and more direct statement would be:\n\n**\"Erich Nowsch was arrested for murdering his neighbor, Tammy Meyers, in a road rage incident, with the victim having previously tried to help him.\"**\n\n### Verifying the Answer\n\nLet's ensure this captures the essence:\n\n- **Arrest of Erich Nowsch**: Yes, that's the central event.\n- **Murder of Tammy Meyers**: Correct, that's the crime.\n- **Road Rage Incident**: Yes, that's the context.\n- **Victim's Prior Help**: Yes, Tammy tried to help Nowsch.\n\nThis seems to encompass the main points without unnecessary details.\n\n### Alternative Approach: Using the 5 Ws and H\n\nAnother method to find the main idea is to use the 5 Ws and H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How):\n\n- **Who**: Erich Nowsch and Tammy Meyers.\n- **What**: Nowsch was arrested for murdering Meyers.\n- **When**: The incident occurred a week ago; the arrest was on Thursday.\n- **Where**: Las Vegas, in their neighborhood and a park.\n- **Why**: The cause is described as a road rage incident.\n- **How**: The murder happened in front of Meyers' home.\n\nCombining these:\n\n**\"In Las Vegas, Erich Nowsch was arrested for murdering his neighbor, Tammy Meyers, in a road rage incident that occurred a week ago in front of her home.\"**\n\nThis version is more detailed but still concise.\n\n### Comparing Both Versions\n\nThe first version focuses more on the victim's prior actions, while the second emphasizes the timing and location of the incident. Both are valid, but the first one might be more aligned with the article's emphasis on Tammy's efforts to help Nowsch.\n\n### Deciding on the Best Answer\n\nGiven that the article mentions Tammy's attempts to help Nowsch multiple times, it seems important to include that in the main idea. Therefore, the first version is more comprehensive.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**\"A young man, Erich Nowsch, was arrested for the murder of his neighbor, Tammy Meyers, in a road rage incident, with the victim having previously tried to help the suspect.\"**\n\nHowever, to make it even more precise and concise, I can refine it further:\n\n**\"Erich Nowsch was arrested for murdering his neighbor, Tammy Meyers, in a road rage incident, with the victim having previously tried to assist him.\"**\n\nBut perhaps the most straightforward and clear statement is:\n\n**\"The article reports the arrest of Erich Nowsch for the murder of his neighbor, Tammy Meyers, in a road rage incident, highlighting the victim's prior efforts to help the suspect.\"**\n\nAfter considering all these, I think the most accurate and concise main idea is:\n\n**\"Erich Nowsch was arrested for the murder of his neighbor, Tammy Meyers, in a road rage incident, with the victim having previously tried to help him.\"**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the article and considering different approaches to summarizing its main idea, I conclude that the central point is the arrest of Erich Nowsch for the murder of Tammy Meyers in a road rage incident, with a notable detail about Tammy's prior attempts to assist Nowsch.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**\"Erich Nowsch was arrested for the murder of his neighbor, Tammy Meyers, in a road rage incident, with the victim having previously tried to help him.\"**"}

Barack Obama had just been elected president as Casillas was leaving the work force. \n\nNearly four years later, as Obama seeks reelection, Casillas has finally landed his first full-time job, emerging out of the group known as the long-term unemployed. \n\nThe Labor Department's July employment figures on Friday showed the average duration of unemployment shrank from 39.9 weeks in June to 38.8 weeks in July. The percentage of people who are unemployed long-term (27 weeks or longer) shrank from 41.9% in June to 40.7% in July. \n\nCasillas says his life is evidence that the economy is beginning to turn around. But the road to his new job was painful, heartbreaking and financially devastating. \n\nJuly jobs report: Hiring picks up, unemployment rises \n\nHe remembers his life pre-November 2008: He wore expensive suits, drove a Mercedes and spent every cent of his paycheck. When he was laid off, he thought he'd be back at work in two weeks. \n\nHe was wrong. \n\nThe subprime mortgage crisis was eating away at the U.S. economy. Employers were shedding jobs, not adding them. A few credits shy of his associate degree, Casillas found himself overqualified for many jobs but underqualified for higher-paid middle-class ones. \n\n\"Overqualified, what does that mean?\" Casillas remembers. \"They kept telling me that. Meanwhile, my life is going down the drain.\" \n\nHe lost his house, his Mercedes, and then his wife left him. In his 40s, he was forced to take the humiliating step of moving in with his mother.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nSports Illustrated is an American sports media franchise owned by Time Inc. Its self-titled magazine has over 3 million subscribers and is read by 23 million people each week, including over 18 million men. It was the first magazine with circulation over one million to win the National Magazine Award for General Excellence twice. Its swimsuit issue, which has been published since 1964, is now an annual publishing event that generates its own television shows, videos and calendars. \n\nThere were two magazines named \"Sports Illustrated\" before the current magazine began on August 16, 1954. In 1936, Stuart Scheftel created \"Sports Illustrated\" with a target market for the sportsman. He published the magazine from 1936 to 1938 on a monthly basis. The magazine was a life magazine size and focused on golf, tennis, and skiing with articles on the major sports. He then sold the name to Dell Publications, which released \"Sports Illustrated\" in 1949 and this version lasted 6 issues before closing. Dell's version focused on major sports (baseball, basketball, boxing) and competed on magazine racks against \"Sport\" and other monthly sports magazines. During the 1940s these magazines were monthly and they did not cover the current events because of the production schedules. There was no large-base, general, weekly sports magazine with a national following on actual active events. It was then that \"Time\" patriarch Henry Luce began considering whether his company should attempt to fill that gap. At the time, many believed sports was beneath the attention of serious journalism and did not think sports news could fill a weekly magazine, especially during the winter.

He was licked again! \n\n\"Oh, Boscoe!\" the little boy said with joy as he kissed his furry little brown dog. The dog had been Scott's friend for as long as could remember. They went on many adventures together. The two of them really never left each other's side and Scott woke up many times this way. \n\nOne of the most memorable adventures that Scott and Boscoe had happened when Scott was 12. Scott wanted to have a little fun. He also wanted to adventure with Boscoe. Scott had got done eating breakfast and wanted to ride his bicycle. Boscoe was walking and Scott was riding his bicycle down by the park very close to the river near Scott's house. He wanted to do a little adventuring. Boscoe was walking next to the shore and started barking his head off!

Luckily, the Academy has proven itself to be pretty darn predictable over the years. If you're America's Sweetheart, you'll probably win Best Actress. If you sing in a flick, you are almost guaranteed Oscar gold. But there's another trend we've been noticing lately: the winners for Best Actress and Best Actor tend to be the person who's taken on the based-on-a-true-story role.

But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks. \n\nSeveral yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying. \n\nBut when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, \"Oh, my God, she fell in!\"Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. \"No ! Not you ! \"his girlfriend screamed after him. \n\nShe was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station. \n\nIt was hard to lift her. She was just out.

If I had to do it over again, I'd do it in a minute,\" Dick Cheney says in \"The World According to Dick Cheney,\" which debuts at 9 p.m. ET on Showtime. \n\nThe two-hour documentary tells the story of Cheney's life through his own comments, supplemented by a narrator and interviews with journalists, biographers, former aides and his longtime friend and mentor Donald Rumsfeld, the former secretary of Defense. \n\nWhile the film covers Cheney's unprecedented and controversial role as vice president, the first half of the film explores the surprising tale of his rise from a two-time Yale dropout with two drunk-driving arrests to the man who once stood behind the leader of the free world. \n\nIn \"The World According to Dick Cheney,\" produced by R.J. Cutler — also known for \"The War Room\" and \"The September Issue\" -- the former Washington powerhouse gets personal, but he still maintains his ever-steady, matter-of-fact tone. \n\n\"When you came in at night after work, you'd go to the bar and down large quantities of Coors beer,\" he stated coolly, referring to the two times he was arrested for drinking and driving in his home state of Wyoming. \n\nNoticeably absent from the documentary are details about Cheney's post-White House life. The 72-year-old gives little to no insight about his heart transplant last year or his decision to support same-sex marriage. His younger daughter Mary wed her longtime partner Heather Poe in June. \n\nQ: Who is starring in the documentary?\n\nA: Dick Cheney\n\nQ: What position did he hold?\n\nA: vice president\n\nQ: What did he have on his criminal record?\n\nA: drunk-driving arrests\n\nQ: What had he been drinking?\n\nA: Coors beer\n\nQ: Where was he?\n\nA: Wyoming\n\nQ: How old is he at the time of the documentary?\n\nA: 72\n\nQ: What's the name of his daughter-in-law?\n\nA: Heather Poe\n\nQ: How long is the movie?\n\nA: two-hours\n\nQ: Will the whole movie be narrated by Cheney himself?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: What will the title of it be?\n\nA: \"The World According to Dick Cheney\"\n\nQ: What major surgery has he undergone?\n\nA: heart transplant\n\nQ: What school did he leave?\n\nA: Yale\n\nQ: How many times?\n\nA: two\n\nQ: Who helped coach him throughout his career?\n\nA: Donald Rumsfeld\n\nQ: What position had he held?\n\nA: secretary of Defense\n\nQ: Will he speak in the movie?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: Does Cheney regret his past?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: What network aired the documentary?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "A: Showtime"}

This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire, until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton, now called Plymouth. In 1620, the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony – the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America. During the English Civil War the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646. \n\nThroughout the Industrial Revolution, Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port, handling imports and passengers from the Americas, and exporting local minerals (tin, copper, lime, china clay and arsenic) while the neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town. In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns, viz., the county borough of Plymouth, the county borough of Devonport, and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single County Borough. The combined town took the name of Plymouth which, in 1928, achieved city status. The city's naval importance later led to its targeting and partial destruction during World War II, an act known as the Plymouth Blitz. After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967.\n\nQ: What grew as a commercial port during the Industrial Revolution?\n\nA: Plymouth\n\nQ: What is it located on the south coast of?\n\nA: Devon\n\nQ: In what country?\n\nA: England\n\nQ: What does Plymouth's early history extend to?\n\nA: the Bronze Age\n\nQ: Where was a first settlement?\n\nA: at Mount Batten\n\nQ: What happened in 1620?\n\nA: the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony\n\nQ: Was it the first English settlement?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: Which number was it?\n\nA: the second\n\nQ: Who held it during the English Civil War?\n\nA: the Parliamentarians\n\nQ: When was it besieged?\n\nA: between 1642 and 1646\n\nQ: What did the city's naval importance lead to?\n\nA: its targeting and partial destruction during World War II\n\nQ: What happened to the city centre after the war?\n\nA: it was completely rebuilt\n\nQ: What kind of a trading post was the early Plymouth?\n\nA: it was a trading post for the Roman Empire\n\nQ: What village did it get surpassed by?\n\nA: Sutton\n\nQ: What is Sutton called today?\n\nA: Plymouth\n\nQ: Is Plymouth in England, 38 miles south-west of Exeter?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: Which river mouths is it in between?\n\nA: Plym and Tamar\n\nQ: Which boundary do the form?\n\nA: Cornwall\n\nQ: How many miles is it west-south-west of London?\n\nA: 190\n\nQ: What kind of exports came from Plymouth?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "A: 190 miles (310 km) west-south-west of London\n"}

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\n(CNN)As art, film stills are often overlooked. \n\nThe photographers tend to be anonymous; it's easy to imagine their work done by the director or cinematographer. Their images are often lumped in with the promotional machinery: Whether documenting the stars frolicking on set or getting down to business, it's just another form of salesmanship. \n\nWhich is why the work of Ernst Haas is so striking. \n\nHaas, one of the 20th century's great photojournalists and image-makers -- an early member of the great Magnum Photos cooperative who was famous enough in his prime to have been the subject of a Museum of Modern Art exhibit in 1962 -- was also a regular on movie sets.

Not only did the work pay off financially, but the photographers also established relationships with members of the industry, he said. \n\nAnd the stars and directors knew what they were getting: some of the best in the field. Photographers such as Haas were entrusted to bring their talent and style to the work. \n\nThe photographers \"are definitely producing work for posterity, that very much has their own fingerprint on it,\" Jacob said. \n\nSuch distinction is obvious from looking at Haas' work -- some of which is as famous as the movies he worked on. \n\nQ: What art form is usually overlooked?\n\nA: Film stills\n\nQ: Do people usually know who created them?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: Who they actually think created those?\n\nA: Director or cinematographer.\n\nQ: Who is Haas?\n\nA: Photojournalist.\n\nQ: Which era he was active?\n\nA: 20th century\n\nQ: What he was member in?\n\nA: Magnum Photos cooperative.\n\nQ: What was important to them?\n\nA: Working on film sets.\n\nQ: Did the photographers feel the same way?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Who is Jacob?\n\nA: The editor of a new book.\n\nQ: Where he works?\n\nA: Smithsonian American Art Museum.\n\nQ: Was it a lucrative job for photographers in the 50s?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: What other benefits they got from that job?\n\nA: Relationships with members of the industry.\n\nQ: Were the directors happy about it?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: According to Jacob was the photographers creating art work for the future?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: Did some of the works become famous?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Assistant: Yes, some of Haas' works became as famous as the movies he worked on."}

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nThe Board Meeting had come to an end. Bob started to stand up and knocked into the table, spilling his coffee over his notes. \"How embarrassing! I am getting so clumsy in my old age.\" \n\nEveryone had a good laugh, and soon we were all telling stories of our most embarrassing moments. It came around to Frank, who sat quietly listening to the others. Someone said, \"Come on, Frank. Tell us your most embarrassing moment.\" \n\nFrank laughed and began to tell us of his childhood. \"I grew up in San Pedro. My Dad was a fisherman, and he loved the sea. He had his own boat, but it was hard making a living on the sea. He worked hard and would stay out until he caught enough to feed the family. Not just enough for our family, but also for his Mom and Dad and the other kids that were still at home.\" \n\nHe looked at us and said, \"I wish you could have met my Dad. He was a big man, and he was strong from pulling the nets and fighting the seas for his catch. When you got close to him, he smelled like the ocean. He would wear his old canvas, foul-weather coat and his bibbed overalls. His rain hat would be pulled down over his brow. No matter how much my mother washed them, they would still smell of the sea and of fish.\" \n\nFrank's voice dropped a bit. \"When the weather was bad he would drive me to school. He had this old truck that he used in his fishing business. That truck was older than he was. It would wheeze and rattle down the road. You could hear it coming for blocks. As he would drive toward the school, I would shrink down into the seat hoping to disappear. Half the time, he would slam to a stop and the old truck would belch a cloud of smoke. He would pull right up in front, and it seemed like everybody would be standing around and watching. Then he would lean over and give me a big kiss on the cheek and tell me to be a good boy. It was so embarrassing for me. Here, I was twelve years old, and my Dad would lean over and kiss me goodbye!\" \n\nHe paused and then went on, \"I remember the day I decided I was too old for a goodbye kiss. When we got to the school and came to a stop, he had his usual big smile. He started to lean toward me, but I put my hand up and said, \"No, Dad.\" It was the first time I had ever talked to him that way, and he had this surprised look on his face. I said, \"Dad, I'm too old for a goodbye kiss. I'm too old for any kind of kiss.\" My Dad looked at me for the longest time, and his eyes started to tear up. Then he turned and looked out of the windshield . \"You're right,\" he said. \" You are a big boy....a man. I won't kiss you anymore.\" \n\nFrank got a funny look on his face, and the tears began to well up in his eyes, as he spoke. \"It wasn't long after that when my Dad went to sea and never came back. It was a day when most of the fleet stayed in, but not Dad. He had a big family to feed. They found his boat adrift with its nets half in and half out. He must have gotten into a strong wind and was trying to save the nets and the floats.\" \n\nI looked at Frank and saw that tears were running down his cheeks. Frank spoke again. \"Guys, you don't know what I would give to have my Dad give me just one more kiss on the cheek...to feel his rough old face... to smell the ocean on him... to feel his arm around my neck. _ . If I had been a man, I would never have told my Dad I was too old for a goodbye kiss.\"\n\nQ: Why is Frank crying?\n\nA: Dad went to sea and never came back.\n\nQ: Where did he grow up?\n\nA: San Pedro.\n\nQ: What did his dad do for a job?\n\nA: fisherman\n\nQ: Did he own a boat\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: Was this a hard job?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: What did he smell like?\n\nA: the ocean\n\nQ: Did he ever transport his kid to school?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: When?\n\nA: During bad weather.\n\nQ: How old was he?\n\nA: 12\n\nQ: Was he proud of his dad's vehicle?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: What was it?\n\nA: Truck\n\nQ: How old was it?\n\nA: Older than his dad.\n\nQ: Did you know when it was close?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: How?\n\nA: It would wheeze.\n\nQ: Where did he park to drop of his son?\n\nA: in front\n\nQ: What did the car emit when it came to a sudden stop?\n\nA: A cloud of smoke\n\nQ: What was he attempting to do when a strong wind happened?\n\nA: save the nets.\n\nQ: Did they find the boat?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: Did they find his dad?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: What would he like now from his dad?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: Why is Frank crying?\n\nA: Frank is crying because he misses his dad deeply and regrets not appreciating the simple gestures of affection, like a goodbye kiss, when he had the chance.

Pontus had recently fallen to the Roman Republic, and although politically he was a proponent of Roman imperialism, Strabo belonged on his mother's side to a prominent family whose members had held important positions under the previous resisting regime of King Mithridates VI of Pontus. \n\nStrabo's life was characterized by extensive travels. He journeyed to Egypt and Kush, as far west as coastal Tuscany and as far south as Ethiopia in addition to his travels in Asia Minor and the time he spent in Rome. Travel throughout the Mediterranean and Near East, especially for scholarly purposes, was popular during this era and was facilitated by the relative peace enjoyed throughout the reign of Augustus (27 BC – AD 14). He moved to Rome in 44 BC, and stayed there, studying and writing, until at least 31 BC. In 29 BC, on his way to Corinth (where Augustus was at the time), he visited the island of Gyaros in the Aegean Sea.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nLeeds is a city in West Yorkshire, England. Historically in Yorkshire's West Riding, the history of Leeds can be traced to the 5th century, when the name referred to a wooded area of the Kingdom of Elmet. The name has been applied to many administrative entities over the centuries. It changed from being the name of a small manorial borough in the 13th century, through several incarnations, to being the name attached to the present metropolitan borough. In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool. \n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, Leeds developed into a major mill town; wool was the dominant industry but flax, engineering, iron foundries, printing, and other industries were important. From being a compact market town in the valley of the River Aire in the 16th century Leeds expanded and absorbed the surrounding villages to become a populous urban centre by the mid-20th century. Leeds has a population of around 781,700 (2016) making it the third largest city in the United Kingdom. The city lies within the United Kingdom's fourth-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.3 million. \n\nToday, Leeds has the most diverse economy of all the UK's main employment centres and has seen the fastest rate of private-sector jobs growth of any UK city and has the highest ratio of public to private sector jobs of all the UK's Core Cities. Leeds has the third-largest jobs total by local authority area with 480,000 in employment and self-employment at the beginning of 2015. Leeds is also ranked as a gamma world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network; and is considered the cultural, financial and commercial heart of the West Yorkshire Urban Area.

The Mangrove Rivulus, a kind of little fish, lives in small pools of water. When their living place dries up, they live. on the land, said Scott Taylor, a researcher in Florida. The fish can grow as large as three inches. They group together and breathe air through their skin before they can find water again. The new scientific discovery came during a trip. \"We were travelling for fun. and one day I kicked over a log and the fish came out,\" Taylor told reporters by telephone. He said he would make his study on the fish known to the public in an American magazine early next year. In lab tests, Taylor said he found the fish can live up to 66 days out of water without eating. Some other fish can live out of water for a short period of time. The walking catfish found in Southeast Asia can stay on land for hours at a time, while lungfish found in Australia, Africa and South America can live out of water, but only in a not active way. But no other known fish can be out of water as long as the Mangrove Rivulus and keep active, according to Patricia Wright, a biologist at a Canadian University.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nA new study suggests that early exposure to germs strengthens the immune system. That means letting children get a little dirty might be good for their health later in life. \n\nThe study involved laboratory mice. It found that adult mice raised in a germ-free environment were more likely to develop allergies, asthma and other autoimmune disorders. There are more than eighty disorders where cells that normally defend the body instead attack tissues and organs. \n\nRichard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts. He says,in 1989,medical researchers who sought to explain these diseases, first discovered that the increasing use of antibacterial soaps and other products, especially early in life, could weaken immune systems. \n\nNow, Dr. Blumberg and his team have what is the first biological evidence to link early exposure to germs to stronger adult immune systems. They say this exposure could prevent the development of some autoimmune diseases. \n\nIn the adult germ-free mice, they found that inflammation in the lungs and colon was caused by so-called killer T cells. These normally fight infection. But they became overactive and targeted healthy tissue--an autoimmune condition seen in asthma and a disease called ulcerative colitis . \n\nDr. Blumberg says the mice raised in a normal environment did not have the same reaction. He says their immune systems had been \"educated\" by early exposure to germs. \n\nRates of autoimmune disorders are rising worldwide, but mostly in wealthier, industrialized countries.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nGeorge Washington Carver showed that plant life was more than just food for animals and humans. Carver's first step was to analyze plant parts to find out what they were made of. He then combined these simpler isolated substances with other substances to create new products. \n\nThe branch of chemistry that studies and finds ways to use raw materials from farm products to make industrial products is called chemurgy. Carver was one of the first and greatest chemurgists of all time. Today the science of chemurgy is better known as the science of synthetics . Each day people depend on and use synthetics made from raw materials. All his life Carver battled against the disposal of waste materials, and warned of the growing need to develop substitutes for the natural substances being used up by humans. \n\nCarver never cared about getting credit for the new products he created. He never tried to patent his discoveries or get wealthy from them. He turned down many offers to leave Tuskegee Institute to become a scientist in private industry. Thomas Edison, inventor of the electric light, offered him a laboratory in Detroit to carry out food research. When the United States government made him a collaborator in the Mycology and Plant Disease Survey of the Department of Agriculture, he accepted the position with the understanding that he wouldn't leave Tuskegee.

Then he gave it a gentle touch. \"She always does that,\" he explained, \"It is like the finishing pat a mother gives her child's hair after she has brushed it. I don't know why I do it. I just do it.\" \n\nAs he talked, I went to a little black-walnut shelf that held a small picture of the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. There was a sweetness and softness in the woman's expression. The man stared at the picture. \"Nineteen her last birthday. That was the day we married. When you see her...ah, just wait until you meet her!\" \"Where is she now?\" I asked. \"Oh, she is away visiting her parents. This is Wednesday,\" he said slowly. \"She will be back on Saturday, in the evening.\" \n\nThat night, I stayed. The man told me his name was Henry. \n\nThursday evening we had two visitors, Tom and Joe. \"We just drop over to ask when little madam is coming home. Any news from her?\" \"Oh yes,\" the man replied. \"A letter.\" He took a yellowed letter out of his wallet and read it. It was full of loving messages. While reading, he glimpsed his friends and cried out, \"Oh no, you are doing it again, Tom! Take your hands away and let me see your eyes. I'm going to tell her this time!\" \"No, you mustn't do that, Henry,\" the grey-haired miner said. \"I am getting old. And any little sorrow makes me cry. Lord, we miss her so.\" \n\nSaturday finally came. \n\nI was glad to see his two friends, Tom and Joe, with guitars, coming down the road as the sun began to set. They put the flowers they brought in vases and began to play some fast and lively songs. \n\nHenry's friends kept giving him glasses of whiskey. When I reached for one of the two remaining glasses, Tom stopped my arm. \"Drop that! Take the other.\" he whispered. I did so. Henry was served last. He had hardly swallowed his drink when the clock struck midnight. His face grew paler and paler. \"Boys,\" he said, \"I am sick with fear. Help! I want to lie down.\" Henry was asleep almost before the words were out of his mouth. \n\nIn a moment, those handy men had his clothes off and tucked him into his bed. They seemed to be getting ready to leave. So I said, \"Please don't go, gentlemen. She won't know me. I am a stranger.\" They glanced at each other. Then Joe said, \"She? Poor thing, she's been dead nineteen years!\" \"Dead?\" I whispered. \"That or worse.\" he said. \n\n\"She went to see her folks half a year after she got married. On her way back, on a Saturday evening in June, when she was almost here, the Indians captured her. She's never been heard of since. Henry _ . He thinks she is still alive. When June comes, he thinks she has gone on her trip to see her parents. Then he begins to wait for her to come back. We drop in here, three days before she's due, to encourage him up and listen to him read the letter. On Saturday we all come and get everything ready for a dance. We've done it for nineteen years. The first Saturday there were twenty-seven of us, but only two now. We drug him to sleep through the night.

I called you up at your office weeks ago, and an acid voice informed me that you were no longer there. Have you been fired?\" \n\n\"Yes,\" said John. \"Why aren't you on the _News_ any more? Nobody seemed to know where you were, till I met Faraday this morning, who told me you were here.\" \n\nSmith was conscious of an impression that in some subtle way John had changed since their last meeting. For a moment he could not have said what had given him this impression. Then it flashed upon him. Before, John had always been, like Mrs. Fezziwig in \"The Christmas Carol,\" one vast substantial smile. He had beamed cheerfully on what to him was evidently the best of all possible worlds. Now, however, it would seem that doubts had occurred to him as to the universal perfection of things. His face was graver. His eyes and his mouth alike gave evidence of disturbing happenings. \n\nIn the matter of confidences, Smith was not a believer in spade-work.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nMyocardial infarction (MI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow stops to a part of the heart causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it is in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms, with women more likely than men to present atypically. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, or cardiac arrest. \n\nMost MIs occur due to coronary artery disease. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, and excessive alcohol intake, among others. The mechanism of an MI often involves the complete blockage of a coronary artery caused by a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. MIs are less commonly caused by coronary artery spasms, which may be due to cocaine, significant emotional stress, and extreme cold, among others. A number of tests are useful to help with diagnosis, including electrocardiograms (ECGs), blood tests, and coronary angiography. An ECG may confirm an ST elevation MI if ST elevation is present.

Recently more and more hospitals and clinics have been _ the power of music -not only to comfort patients, but to help cure them as well. Welcome to the world of music therapy . \n\nAfter each of the two world wars, musicians visited hospitals and played instruments for injured soldiers suffering from emotional and physical pain. Today's music therapists continue this practice, playing instruments such as guitars and harps to bring comfort to their audiences. \n\nTherapist Eric Mammen encourages his patients at a children's hospital to participate with him as he plays. During visits with 13-year-old cancer patient Lawrence Garcia, Mammen encourages Garcia to beat on electric drums while he plays the guitar. The therapy won't cure his cancer, but it does, according to Garcia's mom, take away much of the boy's depression . \n\nMusic therapy can put patients in better moods and ease the symptoms of depression according to the American Music Therapy Association. Other benefits include relieving pain, calming tension, aiding sleep, reducing worry or fear, and easing muscle tension. \n\nJose Haro personally experienced the benefits of music therapy when he was recovering from heart surgery. During his recovery, he played a piano whose keys lit up, indicating which keys to touch to play along with the background music. Soon he was playing tunes and noticing something strange. \"I was searching for my pain.\" He says of his experience, \"but it was gone.\" \n\nWhile Haro's experience provides an evidence of the power of music to relieve pain, scientific research has proven music also helps patients with Alzheimer's disease and arthritis. \n\nIn addition, music therapy helps premature babies. Doctors are tapping into a powerful way to teach premature babies that haven't yet learned how to suck. Doctors use a device that comforts the babies by playing music when they suck on a pacifier . Soon the babies learn to suck in return for music, gaining weight faster and going home earlier than those who do not use the device. \n\nEven perfectly healthy people are discovering the power of music to calm and heal.

Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \"work\" refers to an author's work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year. The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. \n\nAlthough the Nobel Prize in Literature has become the world's most prestigious literature prize, the Swedish Academy has attracted significant criticism for its handling of the award. Many authors who have won the prize have fallen into obscurity, while others rejected by the jury remain widely studied and read, like Ruben Darío. The prize has \"become widely seen as a political one - a peace prize in literary disguise\", whose judges are prejudiced against authors with different political tastes to them. Tim Parks has expressed skepticism that it is possible for \"Swedish professors ... [to] compar[e] a poet from Indonesia, perhaps translated into English with a novelist from Cameroon, perhaps available only in French, and another who writes in Afrikaans but is published in German and Dutch...\". As of 2016, 16 of the 113 recipients have been of Scandinavian origin. The Academy has often been alleged to be biased towards European, and in particular Swedish, authors.

Henkel was surprised by how obsessed people are with taking pictures these days - before dinner, during friends' birthday parties, on museum tours and so on.You know people just like that, don't you? They keep taking pictures because they think that it helps record the moment, but as Henkel's latest study has just found out, this obsession may prevent their brains from remembering what actually happened, reported The Guardian. In her study, Henkel led a group of college students around a museum and asked them to simply observe 15 objects and to photograph 15 others.The next day the students' memory of the tour was tested, and the results showed that they were less accurate in recognizing the objects and they remembered fewer details about them if they photographed them. \"When people rely on technology to remember for them - counting on the camera to record the event and thus not needing to attend to it fully themselves, it can have a negative effect on how well they remember their experiences,\" Henkel explained. But there is also an exception: if students zoomed in to photograph part of an object, their memory actually improved, and those who focused the lens on a specific area could even recall parts that weren't in the frame. So basically, this study is saying that constantly taking pictures can harm your memory.But shouldn't reviewing pictures we have taken help wake up our memories?

The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to earn their third Super Bowl title. The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California. As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the \"golden anniversary\" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as \"Super Bowl L\"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50. \n\nThe Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC Championship Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise was founded in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record, and denied the New England Patriots a chance to defend their title from Super Bowl XLIX by defeating them 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game.

But these days, the hunter has become the hunted, because of better methods from commercial fishermen who are looking for fins to make expensive soup sold mostly in Asia. Shark fins are far more valuable than shark meat, so fishermen cut the fins off live fish and throw the sharks overboard to maximize the catch they bring back. \n\nShark finning is illegal in the United States, but there're tournament sport fishermen, who target and kill the biggest ones they take from the sea. These tournaments, the prizes of which can reach $5,000 or more, attract large crowds of anglers but also draw protests from animal rights groups and environmentalists. \n\nThe competitors say they are enjoying a fun and legal sport, the impact on the overall shark population is very small, and most of the sharks caught are returned to the ocean. Dave Johnson, who is from Kennebunkport, Maine, said no one ever comes close to the limit set by the government of killing one shark per day during the three-month season. \n\n\"I enjoy watching these animals, but I also enjoy catching and releasing them, and very rarely killing them and eating them,\" he said. \"If I thought killing one shark was endangering the species and contributing to their decline I'd stop doing it tomorrow.\" \n\nThat is exactly what marine biologists like Luke Tipple want to happen. \"I believe that they should just stop it.

At first he sniffed at a distance, ready for instant flight. Then he drew cautiously closer. Jerry watched him with smouldering eyes.

A noisy outburst of boys' laughter in the distance caused him to crouch suddenly down, his claws thrust into the ground for purchase, his muscles tense springs for the leap he knew not in what direction, from the danger he knew not what that might threaten him. Then he identified the noise, know that no harm impended, and resumed his stealthy advance on the Irish terrier. \n\nWhat might have happened there is no telling, for at that moment Bashti's eyes chanced to rest on the golden puppy for the first time since the capture of the _Arangi_.

He named the area in honor of \"God's merciful Providence\" which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers to settle. The city is situated at the mouth of the Providence River at the head of Narragansett Bay. \n\nProvidence was one of the first cities in the country to industrialize and became noted for its textile manufacturing and subsequent machine tool, jewelry, and silverware industries. Today, the city of Providence is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning which have shifted the city's economy into service industries, though it still retains some manufacturing activity. The city was once nicknamed the \"Beehive of Industry\"; it began rebranding itself as the \"Creative Capital\" in 2009 to emphasize its educational resources and arts community. \n\nThe city is located in Providence County and is the third most populous city in New England, after Boston and Worcester.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nEinstein's connection with the politics of the nuclear bomb is well known: He signed the letter to President Franklin Roosevelt that persuaded the United States to take the idea seriously, and he engaged in postwar efforts to prevent nuclear war. But these were not just the isolated actions of a scientist dragged into the world of politics. Einstein's life was, in fact, \"divided between politics and equations .\" \n\nSickened by what he saw as the waste of human lives during the First World War, he became involved in antiwar demonstrations. His support of civil disobedience did little to endear him to his colleagues. Then, following the war, he directed his efforts toward reconciliation and improving international relations. And soon his politics were making it difficult for him to visit the United States, even to give lectures. \n\nEinstein's second great cause was Zionism . Although he was Jewish, Einstein rejected the idea of God. However, a growing awareness of anti-Semitism , both before and during the War, led him gradually to identify with the Jewish community, and later to become an outspoken supporter of Zionism. \n\nHis theories came under attack. One man was accused of motivating others to murder Einstein and fined a mere six dollars. When a book was published entitled 100 Authors Against Einstein, he retorted, \"If I were wrong, then one would have been enough!\" When Hitler came to power, Einstein then in America declared he would not return to Germany. While Nazi attacked his house and confiscated his bank account, a Berlin newspaper displayed the headline \"Good News from Einstein--He's Not Coming Back.\" \n\nFearing that German scientists would build a nuclear bomb, Einstein proposed that the United States should develop its own. But he was publicly warning of the dangers of nuclear war and proposing international control of nuclear weaponry. Throughout his life, Einstein's efforts toward peace probably achieved little and won him few friends. His support of the Zionist cause, however, was recognized in 1952, when he was offered the presidency of Israel. He declined, saying he was too naive in politics.

To him the plebeian Smithsye laughingly:-- \n\n\"Cully! how's his nibs?\" \n\nI pushed the door of the school-room open. There are some spectacles which a man never forgets. The burning of Troy probably seemed a large-sized conflagration to the pious Aeneas, and made an impression on him which he carried away with the feeble Anchises. \n\nIn the centre of the room, lightly brandishing the piston-rod of a steam-engine, stood Guy Heavystone alone. I say alone, for the pile of small boys on the floor in the corner could hardly be called company. \n\nI will try and sketch him for the reader. Guy Heavystone was then only fifteen. His broad, deep chest, his sinewy and quivering flank, his straight pastern, showed him to be a thoroughbred. Perhaps he was a trifle heavy in the fetlock, but he held his head haughtily erect. His eyes were glittering but pitiless. There was a sternness about the lower part of his face,--the old Heavystone look,--a sternness, heightened, perhaps, by the snaffle-bit which, in one of his strange freaks, he wore in his mouth to curb his occasional ferocity. His dress was well adapted to his square-set and herculean frame. A striped knit undershirt, close-fitting striped tights, and a few spangles set off his figure; a neat Glengarry cap adorned his head. On it was displayed the Heavystone crest, a cock regardant on a dunghill or, and the motto, \"Devil a better!\" \n\nQ: What sound came from the school room?\n\nA: A dull, crashing sound.\n\nQ: Did the author react to it?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: What did he do?\n\nA: Shuddered involuntarily.\n\nQ: Did he ask anyone about the ruckus?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Who?\n\nA: Smithums.\n\nQ: How old was Guy Heavystone at the time?\n\nA: Fifteen.\n\nQ: Did he have a small, shallow chest?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: How was it described?\n\nA: Broad, deep chest.\n\nQ: What about his flank?\n\nA: Sinewy and quivering.\n\nQ: And pastern?\n\nA: Straight.\n\nQ: Did Smithums reply to the author?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: How did he explain the noise?\n\nA: Guy's cleaning out the fourth form.\n\nQ: Did someone come by during this?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Who\n\nA: George de Coverly.\n\nQ: Was he holding something?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: What?\n\nA: His nose,\n\nQ: Was there anything in the middle of the school room?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Who?\n\nA: Guy Heavystone.\n\nQ: What about in the corner?\n\nA: A pile of small boys.\n\nQ: What was Guy wearing on his head?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "A: A Glengarry cap.\n"}

Every day she woke up and went to kindergarten, played outside, and watched movies. Sometimes her family would go to a rollercoaster park. Her mom would always try to get her to ride the big rides but she was afraid and wanted to stay in Snoopyland. For two years she stayed in the little kid section of the park. Her big brother who had to babysit her was getting mad because she would not try new rides. She cried more and more until one day she got brave. She went on a little bigger musical ride that went around in circles pretty fast. She got off the ride and loved it! Her mom said to her, \"Okay, let's go on the big kid rides now!\" Megan was afraid again and cried and cried. For the rest of that summer she stayed in the little kid section and went on little rides. The next summer her brother brought his girlfriend home. His girlfriend's name was Sara and she was older, and loved big rides. Megan liked Sara a lot and wanted to make her like her. When Sara asked Megan if she would ride on bigger rides she said yes, and she went on her first real rollercoaster, Thunderhawk. She was frightened at first but when she stepped off the ride she loved it like she had loved the other ride last year! Now was the real test. Sara asked Megan if she wanted to go on the biggest ride in the park. She was afraid but wanted to show Sara how big she was. At the beginning of the ride Megan was afraid and was about to start crying when they went down the first big hill. Her stomach was tickled and she began laughing really loud.

Burton had told him not to dress--\"We don't give dress dinner parties, you know. It's all in the family way with us\"--and Harry, therefore, went direct from Bolton street to Onslow Crescent. But, though he managed to keep the proper course down Piccadilly, he was in such confusion of mind that he hardly knew whither he was going. It seemed as though a new form of life had been opened to him, and that it had been opened in such a way as almost necessarily to engulf him. It was not only that Lady Ongar's history was so terrible, and her life so strange, but that he himself was called upon to form a part of that history, and to join himself in some sort with that life. This countess, with her wealth, her rank, her beauty, and her bright intellect, had called him to her, and told him that he was her only friend. Of course he had promised his friendship. How could he have failed to give such a promise to one whom he had loved so well? But to what must such a promise lead, or rather to what must it not have led had it not been for Florence Burton? She was young, free, and rich. She made no pretence of regret for the husband she had lost, speaking of him as though in truth she hardly regarded herself as his wife. And she was the same Julia whom he had loved, who had loved him, who had jilted him, and in regret for whom he had once resolved to lead a wretched, lonely life!

As the first African American to play in the Major League in modern times, many believe he changed the country forever. Robinson was born in 1919. He lived in a time when rules controlled what African Americans could do. He was a top athlete, playing football, basketball and baseball. But playing for a major League team was off limits to Robinson because of his race. Branch Rickey, president and manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, signed (......) Robinson in 1947. He believed that Robinson not only had the skills, but the courage to face the challenge of becoming modern baseball's first black player. It wasn't easy. Robinson sometimes faced boos from fans. But he became a star, anyway. In 1962, he became the first African-American player chosen to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame. In 2005, he was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award Congress can give to an American. By breaking baseball's color barrier , Robinson opened the door for many to follow his footsteps, not only in baseball, but in other areas of life as well. After he stopped playing the game, Robinson worked as a manager for a coffee company. He wrote a newspaper column .

Here's a summary of the key points from your description:\n\n- **Animal**: Hamster (female)\n- **Diet**: Paper towel rolls (though this is unusual; hamsters typically eat hamster food, seeds, and vegetables like carrots)\n- **Behavior**: She will sit on your shoulder while you do chores or homework. She will return to her home when you bathe or sleep.\n- **Potential Issues**: She might pee unexpectedly, get scared of thunder, or try to escape outside.\n- **Care**: You’ll ensure she has water, food, and love.\n\nA few notes:\n- **Paper Towel Rolls**: While hamsters enjoy chewing on safe materials like cardboard, paper towel rolls are not a typical or recommended food source. Stick to hamster-safe food and occasional treats like carrots.\n- **Biting**: It’s common for hamsters to bite when they’re nervous or scared, but with patience and gentle handling, you can build trust.\n- **Safety**: Keep her in a secure cage to prevent escapes and ensure she’s safe from hazards like open windows or loud noises.\n\nEnjoy your new furry friend! 🐹💕"}

It can be considered a version of five-a-side football. \n\nFutsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. Unlimited substitutions are permitted. Unlike some other forms of indoor football, the game is played on a hard court surface delimited by lines; walls or boards are not used. Futsal is also played with a smaller ball. The surface, ball, and rules create an emphasis on improvisation, creativity, and technique as well as ball control and passing in small spaces. \n\n\"Futsal\" comes from Spanish \"fútbol sala or fútbol de salón\" and from Portuguese \"futebol de salão\". The term is commonly translated as \"indoor football\" but a more literal translation is \"hall/lounge football\". During the sport's second world championships held in Madrid in 1985, the Spanish name \"fútbol sala\" was used.

The naming was due to a dispute between FIFUSA (the predecessor to the AMF) and FIFA over the name of \"fútbol\", FIFUSA has registered the word \"fut-sal\" in 1985 (Madrid, Spain).

Three NATO members (the United States, France and the United Kingdom) are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states. NATO Headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, while the headquarters of Allied Command Operations is near Mons, Belgium. \n\nNATO is an alliance that consists of 29 independent member countries across North America and Europe. An additional 21 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programs. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defense spending is supposed to amount to at least 2% of GDP. \n\nNATO was little more than a political association until the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US Supreme Commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, that formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defense against a prospective Soviet invasion—doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany in 1989, the organization became involved in the breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. Politically, the organization sought better relations with former Warsaw Pact countries, several of which joined the alliance in 1999 and 2004.\n\nQ: What does NATO stand for\n\nA: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n\nQ: What else can it be called\n\nA: North Atlantic Alliance\n\nQ: What is it\n\nA: a military alliance\n\nQ: between who\n\nA: North American and European states\n\nQ: When was it signed\n\nA: 4 April 1949.\n\nQ: who are the permanent members of NATO\n\nA: the United States, France and the United Kingdom\n\nQ: what power do they have\n\nA: veto\n\nQ: do they have nuclear weapons\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: Where are the headquarters of NATO\n\nA: Haren, Brussels, Belgium\n\nQ: where is the ACOs\n\nA: near Mons, Belgium.\n\nQ: how many independent countries are in NATO\n\nA: 29\n\nQ: How many additional for peace program\n\nA: 21\n\nQ: how many for dialogue\n\nA: 15\n\nQ: So how many altogether\n\nA: 65\n\nQ: how much do they spend on military out of all the money\n\nA: over 70%\n\nQ: what war led to a rivalry\n\nA: the Cold War\n\nQ: with what nations\n\nA: nations of the Warsaw Pac\n\nQ: in what year\n\nA: 1955\n\nQ: Did some of those nations ever join NATO\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: In what years\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: In what years\n\nA: 1999 and 2004\n"}

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\n(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has nominated his top counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan, to be the next director of the CIA. \n\nIf there is an emerging Obama doctrine to deal with the threat from al Qaeda and its allies, it is clearly a rejection of the use of conventional military forces and a growing reliance instead on the use of drones and U.S. Special Operations Forces -- and Brennan has been central to Obama's policy. \n\nIn an April 30 speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, Brennan laid out the rationale for the drone policy in more detail than any administration official had done publicly hitherto. He asserted that the drone strikes are legal both under the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress after the September 11 attacks and because, \"There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat.\" \n\nThis does not appear to be the view of Ben Emmerson, U.N. special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights, who announced plans at Harvard Law School in October to launch an investigation into U.S. drone attacks and the extent to which they cause civilian casualties. \n\nPolitics: Compared to Hagel, reaction to Brennan nomination muted \n\nOne of Brennan's most significant legacies in the four years he has been the president's principal adviser on terrorism is the U.S. drone campaign against al Qaeda and its allies in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen -- one that has shifted focus significantly in the past year or so. \n\nQ: Who did Obama nominate?\n\nA: John Brennan.\n\nQ: To be what?\n\nA: Next director of the CIA.\n\nQ: Was he Obama's adviser before that?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: What kind?\n\nA: His top counterterrorism adviser,\n\nQ: On what day did Brennan give his speech?\n\nA: April 30\n\nQ: At what facility?\n\nA: The Woodrow Wilson Center.\n\nQ: In what location?\n\nA: Washington.\n\nQ: What did Brennan talk about in great detail?\n\nA: The drone policy.\n\nQ: Did he say it was legal or illegal?\n\nA: Legal.\n\nQ: What was passed by Congress?\n\nA: Authorization for Use of Military Force.\n\nQ: After what event was it passed?\n\nA: The September 11 attacks.\n\nQ: Does Ben Emmerson have the same opinion as Brennan?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: What is Emmerson's job title?\n\nA: U.N. special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights.\n\nQ: Where did he announce his plans?\n\nA: Harvard Law School.\n\nQ: In what month?\n\nA: October.\n\nQ: Was he launching an investigation?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Into what?\n\nA: U.S. drone attacks.\n\nQ: And?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Assistant: ### Understanding the Context\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the article. It discusses President Barack Obama's nomination of John Brennan to be the next director of the CIA. Brennan is described as Obama's top counterterrorism adviser. The article highlights a shift in U.S. counterterrorism strategy, moving away from conventional military forces and towards the use of drones and Special Operations Forces. Brennan's speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington on April 30 is mentioned, where he detailed the rationale for the drone policy. He asserts that drone strikes are legal under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed by Congress after 9/11 and under international law. However, Ben Emmerson, the U.N. special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights, disagrees and plans to investigate the civilian casualties caused by U.S. drone attacks.\n\n### Identifying the Key Question\n\nThe specific question I need to answer is: **\"What is the main point of the article?\"**\n\n### Breaking Down the Article\n\nTo find the main point, I'll break down the article into its key components:\n\n1. **Nomination of John Brennan**: Obama nominates his top counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan, to be the next CIA director.\n2. **Shift in Counterterrorism Strategy**: The U.S. is moving away from conventional military forces and relying more on drones and Special Operations Forces.\n3. **Brennan's Speech**: On April 30, Brennan gave a speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, detailing the rationale for the drone policy.\n4. **Legal Justification for Drone Strikes**: Brennan argues that drone strikes are legal under the AUMF and international law.\n5. **Contrasting Views**: Ben Emmerson, the U.N. special rapporteur, disagrees and plans to investigate the legality and impact of drone strikes.\n\n### Determining the Main Point\n\nThe main point of an article is usually the central idea or the most important message it conveys. In this case, the article discusses several related topics, but the overarching theme seems to be the shift in U.S. counterterrorism strategy and the legal and ethical debates surrounding the use of drones.\n\nHowever, the article begins with the nomination of John Brennan, which is a significant event. It then delves into the implications of this nomination, particularly Brennan's role in shaping the counterterrorism strategy and his defense of the drone policy. The contrasting views of Ben Emmerson add another layer to the discussion, highlighting the controversy and debate around the use of drones.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nGiven the structure and content of the article, the main point could be interpreted in a few ways:\n\n1. **The Nomination of John Brennan**: The article starts with this event, but it's not just a report of a nomination; it's about the implications of this nomination.\n2. **The Shift in Counterterrorism Strategy**: The article discusses a significant change in how the U.S. approaches counterterrorism, which is a broader theme.\n3. **The Legal and Ethical Debate on Drone Strikes**: The article presents arguments for and against the legality and morality of drone strikes, which is a contentious issue.\n\n### Deciding on the Main Point\n\nWhile the nomination of John Brennan is a key event, the article goes beyond just reporting the nomination. It explores the reasons behind the nomination, the policies Brennan has been involved in, and the controversies surrounding those policies. Therefore, the main point is not solely about the nomination but about the broader implications of Brennan's role and the counterterrorism strategy he represents.\n\nThe shift in counterterrorism strategy, particularly the increased reliance on drones, seems to be a central theme. The article discusses how this strategy is being justified and the debates it has sparked. Thus, the main point could be the evolution of U.S. counterterrorism tactics and the legal and ethical questions they raise.\n\n### Formulating the Answer\n\nBased on this analysis, the main point of the article is the discussion of the U.S. counterterrorism strategy under President Obama, focusing on the increased use of drones and the legal and ethical debates surrounding this approach, as exemplified by John Brennan's nomination and his defense of the drone policy.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe main point of the article is the discussion of the U.S. counterterrorism strategy under President Obama, particularly the increased reliance on drones and the legal and ethical debates surrounding this approach, as highlighted by the nomination of John Brennan and his defense of the drone policy."}

During the summer, he and his 40 helpers dug at 35 different spots. The only things they found were ground spiders, giant ticks, and deadly snakes. \n\nJust before Thanksgiving says Clapp, _ \n\nBut then Clapp's team looked at the high-tech maps again and saw something surprising. Many of the caravan routes on the high-tech maps came together on the same spot marked \"Omani Marketplace\" on Ptolomy's map. Two maps, made almost 2000 years apart, pointed the team toward the same area! \n\nIn December 1991, Clapp arrived at the spot where, according to the maps, the caravans met. Clapp had a handheld instrument that could detect objects below the ground. It showed ruins under the sand! He and his team started digging. And then they found it! A tower buried in the sand. They slowly unearthed a giant, eight-sided fortress . It had nine towers and many rooms. People had lived in this fortress 2000 years ago. Outside its walls, they had found buried remains of nearly 40 campsites. They seemed to be camping areas for traders . \n\nMore digging found shards, or pieces of pottery from ancient Rome, Greece, China, Egypt, and Syria. Diggers and scientists agree that people were here for about 5000 years. Clapp and his team were excited as they continued to discover more pieces of the past that seemed to prove that it was the lost city of Ubar. \n\n\"We started with this hopeless myth ,\" says Clapp, \"and then finally found the truth behind the myth.\" But is this unearthed site really the once-great Ubar? Experts aren't totally persuaded. \n\nDonald Whitcomb is an archeologist at the University of Chicago.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nIn modern molecular biology and genetics, the genome is the genetic material of an organism. It consists of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA/RNA. \n\nThe term was created in 1920 by Hans Winkler, professor of botany at the University of Hamburg, Germany. The Oxford Dictionary suggests the name to be a blend of the words gene and chromosome. However, see omics for a more thorough discussion. A few related -ome words already existed—such as biome, rhizome, forming a vocabulary into which genome fits systematically. \n\nSome organisms have multiple copies of chromosomes: diploid, triploid, tetraploid and so on. In classical genetics, in a sexually reproducing organism (typically eukarya) the gamete has half the number of chromosomes of the somatic cell and the genome is a full set of chromosomes in a diploid cell. The halving of the genetic material in gametes is accomplished by the segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. In haploid organisms, including cells of bacteria, archaea, and in organelles including mitochondria and chloroplasts, or viruses, that similarly contain genes, the single or set of circular or linear chains of DNA (or RNA for some viruses), likewise constitute the genome. The term genome can be applied specifically to mean what is stored on a complete set of nuclear DNA (i.e., the \"nuclear genome\") but can also be applied to what is stored within organelles that contain their own DNA, as with the \"mitochondrial genome\" or the \"chloroplast genome\". Additionally, the genome can comprise non-chromosomal genetic elements such as viruses, plasmids, and transposable elements.\n\nQ: Who created the term DNA?\n\nA: Hans Winkler\n\nQ: What is a genome?\n\nA: a full set of chromosomes in a diploid cell\n\nQ: When did Hans create the term?\n\nA: 1920\n\nQ: What was his profession?\n\nA: , professor of botany\n\nQ: Where?\n\nA: University of Hamburg,\n\nQ: Where is that located?\n\nA: Germany\n\nQ: Where does the name originate, what two words make up the name?\n\nA: gene and chromosome\n\nQ: Name some organisms that have multiple copies of chromosomes\n\nA: diploid, triploid, tetraploid\n\nQ: In eukarya, compared to a diploid cell, how many chromosomes does it have?\n\nA: half\n\nQ: What is eukarya?\n\nA: a sexually reproducing organism\n\nQ: How does the halving process occur?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: What is a genome?\n\nA: a full set of chromosomes in a diploid cell\n"}

Age-old rivalries. Larger-than-life game day atmospheres. \n\nThat's what's at stake, according to NCAA President Mark Emmert, who described a doomsday scenario if college athletes are paid, when he testified in the case brought by former UCLA basketball star Ed O'Bannon. \n\nEmmert said many school leaders have told him they would not want to pay for athletes. Instead they might opt out of Division I sports into Division II where there is less money for coaches, facilities and scholarships. \n\nSchools that did stay in D1 would likely have to cut less popular sports to afford to pay athletes, he said. \n\nAnd the schools that chose to pay would probably never play the schools that chose not to pay -- preventing a true national championship and putting an end to traditional rivalry games that are fan favorites, Emmert said. \n\nBut that idea is rejected by one of O'Bannon's lawyers, Bill Isaacson. \n\n\"The millions of sports fans who watch these games and everyone at the networks that broadcasts them knows that the games will continue to be played,\" he said. \n\nQ: what sports body is the focus of the article?\n\nA: NCAA\n\nQ: what is being debated?\n\nA: The ability of football players to unionize\n\nQ: how many things does the article want you to know?\n\nA: five\n\nQ: who is the president of the NCAA?\n\nA: Mark Emmert\n\nQ: did he tesitfy?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: who brought the case?\n\nA: Ed O'Bannon\n\nQ: what division has less money for coaches?\n\nA: Division II\n\nQ: what other things do they have less money for?\n\nA: facilities and scholarships\n\nQ: whose lawyer rejected rejected the idea of the national championship tradition being at risk?\n\nA: O'Bannon\n\nQ: what was his name?\n\nA: Bill Isaacson\n\nQ: how many sports fans watch these game?\n\nA: millions\n\nQ: who told Emmert that they would not pay for athletes?\n\nA: school leaders\n\nQ: what might they do as an alternative?\n\nA: they might opt out of Division I sports\n\nQ: who is appealing the ruling that allows football players to unionize?\n\nA: Northwestern University\n\nQ: how many more cases will the judge likely here this year?\n\nA: two more\n\nQ: what is the case that she just heard calling for?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: what is the case that she just heard calling for?\n\nA: The case that the federal judge just heard is calling for revenue from TV deals to be shared with student athletes."}

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nThis year the US will honour one of the country's most famous writers--Mark Twain (1835-1910). Most readers know that his real name was Samuel Longhome Clemens, but how many know where the pen name \"Mark Twain\" came from? The answer shows Clemens' colorful early life before he became a writer. \"Mark Twain\" was the cry shouted on a ship when the ship entered a part of a river that was two fathoms (6 feet) deep. \"Twain\" is an old-fashioned way of saying \"two\". Twain trained as a ship pilot on the Mississippi river for two years, a time that he wrote about in the humourousLife on the Mississippi (1883). The famous river would become an important theme in many of his works--who could forget the journey of the Huck and Jim along it in his most famous book. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884)? With little education, he had to teach himself how to write stories. Whenever possible, he would go to public libraries. There he spent much time reading and thinking, which greatly helped him with his writing. On the other hand, his life experiences gave him wonderful material to write about and attract readers. Twain wrote in a style that has been called \"local colour\" because it shows great knowledge of local people and their customs. This _ is very clear in the two books for which Twain is still celebrated today. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its follow-up The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which many people call \"The Great American Novel\". The most amazing invention in the book is the voice of Huck himself. Huck did not enjoy schooling. It shows in the way he uses language, in a spoken style. Only a master like Twain could copy the way a young southern boy talked so well.\n\nQ: Who is the writer?\n\nA: Mark Twain\n\nQ: What was his name at birth?\n\nA: Samuel Longhorne Clemens\n\nQ: What did he do for a couple of years?\n\nA: trained as a ship pilot\n\nQ: Did he create anything during that time?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: What was it?\n\nA: Life on the Mississippi.\n\nQ: What is another book he wrote?\n\nA: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\n\nQ: What was another one?\n\nA: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\n\nQ: did he have a lot of schooling?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: where did he go to learn?\n\nA: public libraries\n\nQ: When was Life on the Mississippi written?\n\nA: 1883\n\nQ: and Huckleberry Finn?\n\nA: 1884\n\nQ: What does the word twain mean?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: What does the word twain mean?\n\nA: \"Twain\" is an old-fashioned way of saying \"two\".\n"}

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nIsrael was happy, very happy. The news of a deal to bring home the kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit , a young man held prisoner by Hamas for five years,spread. But the happiness was hardened by the reality of the price Israelis had paid to set him free. The 1,027 Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged for the single Israeli corporal turned out to include men and women convicted of some of the worst terrorist attacks in the country. \"Ambivalent,\" says Aya Ilouz, of her feelings on the matter. Strolling in downtown Jerusalem with her husband Liron and their 5-month-old daughter Yael, the couple is so in sync on the question of the day that they finish each other's thoughts. \"Yes,\" says Liron, \"we are very happy and excited to see Gilad meet his family. And on the other hand--\" \"We are very concerned,\" says Aya. \"About what happens next,\" Liron explains. \"When the next terrorist blows himself up, someone will have to answer.\" Just around the corner, on King George Street, Alan Bauer had been walking home with his son on March 21, 2002, when a Palestinian man named Mohammad Hashaika exploded a suicide vest packed with metal scraps. Eighty-four people were wounded that day. Of the three killed, one was a woman pregnant with twins. Though the bomber of course died, Israeli courts convicted the two women who drove him to the site of the bombing, easing his way past the Israeli checkpoint by buying flowers to carry in the Mother's Day crowd. \"These women, as I speak, are being released,\" Bauer says. Specifics have a way of weakening the joy of Shalit's release. Among the 477 prisoners released on Tuesday, in the first phase of the exchange, are an organizer of the 2002 Passover bombing that killed 30 people; a woman who developed an online relationship with a lovesick Israeli youth she then had murdered when he came to meet her; and the man who proudly displayed his bloody hands to the mob gathered outside the Ramallah building where two Israeli soldiers were beaten to death after making a wrong turn on Oct. 12, 2000. When the list became public, s of terrorism victims appealed, without success, to Israel's supreme court to prevent the prisoner exchange. The court hearing was interrupted repeatedly by upset survivors, including Shvuel Schijveschuurder, who lost five of his family members in a 2001 attack at a Jerusalem Sbarro. To protest the release of the woman who drove the suicide bomber to the pizza restaurant, Schijveschuurder poured paint on a memorial to Yitzhak Rabin, the Prime Minister slain by an Israeli extremist for signing the Oslo Accords. \"When we say 1,027 prisoners will be released, it's abstract, it doesn't mean anything,\" says Eliad Moreh Rosenberg, who was wounded in the 2002 terrorism bombing at the Hebrew University cafeteria. \"But for victims of terror, it's a reality.\" Israeli officials calculate that 60% of those released resume terrorism attacks. To help prevent that resumption this time around, Israel insisted that most of the prisoners liberated be sent either to the Gaza Strip -- which is sealed off from Israel and under the control of Hamas, which says it continues to observe a cease-fire -- or into exile in Turkey, Qatar or Syria. About 100 arrived in the West Bank, where the government led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas works diligently to suppress terrorism, cooperating with Israeli intelligence and military. With the future uncertain, on Tuesday, Jewish Israelis stopped and stared at televisions wherever they came upon them. On the sidewalk at midmorning outside the 24-hour Hillel Market, 50 people were gathered under a flat screen to catch the first images of Shalit, looking painfully thin . \"It was moving. It was very exciting,\" says Anat Rubin, 42. \"I just saw photos of him getting out of the car.

Yet not all Labs are the same. \n\nJohn Grogan discovered _ after he and his wife adopted a Labrador that they named Marley. The dog caused Mr. Grogan a lot of trouble, but it also provided many stories for his newspaper articles. Later, he wrote a best-selling book, \"Marley and Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog.\" \n\nMarley was happy and fun-loving. But he was also extremely large and difficult to control. He bit anything that he could find around the house, including plastic, clothing and jewelry. And he had a great fear of loud noises, especially thunderstorms. Unfortunately, the Grogans lived in Florida where many thunderstorms develop. Marley would attack the furniture, walls and doors until his feet bled if he was left alone in the house during a thunderstorm. Marley almost damaged their home several times. \n\nJohn Grogan said that at first he considered that probably his dog could be trained to be a show champion. But he soon realized that was impossible. Marley didn't like to learn skills that didn't belong to dogs, and he was driven out of the dog training school for causing troubles for other dogs. He didn't want to hide his emotions. He would show his anger and tiredness if he felt them. \n\nEven if that, Marley still had earned a place in the Grogans'. He didn't know how to dance, and he didn't know how to walk on its two legs, but he was what he was.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nAs we drove along, my spirits went up again, and I turned, with pleasure, to the thought of the new life which I was entering. But though it was not far past the middle of September, the heavy clouds and strong north-easterly wind combined to make the day extremely cold; and the journey seemed a very long one, so that it was nearly one o'clock before we reached the place of our destination. Yet when we entered the gateway, my heart failed me, and I wished it were a mile or two farther off. For the first time in my life I must stand alone: there was no retreating now. I must enter that house, and introduce myself among its strange people. But how was it to be done? True, I was near nineteen; but, thanks to the protecting care of my mother and sister, I well knew that many a girl of fifteen, or under, was gifted with a more womanly address, and greater ease and self-possession, than I was. Yet, anyway. I would do very well, after all; and the children, of course, I should soon be at ease with them. \n\n\"Be calm, be calm, whatever happens,\" I said within myself; and truly I was so fully occupied in steadying my nerves and keeping down the rebellious beat of my heart that when I was admitted into the hall and into the presence of Mrs. Bloomfield, I almost forgot to answer her polite greeting; and it afterwards struck me that the little I did say was spoken in the tone of one half-dead or half-asleep. \n\nWith due politeness, however, she showed me my bedroom, and left me there to take a little refreshment for a little while and led me into the dining-room. Some beefsteaks and potatoes were set before me; and while I dined upon these, she sat opposite, watching me (as I thought) and trying to keep something like a conversation-- consisting chiefly of commonplace remarks. In fact, my attention was almost wholly absorbed in my dinner: not from appetite, but from the toughness of the beefsteaks, and the numbness of my hands. \n\n\"I have had so little time to attend to their education myself, but I think they are clever children, and very willing to learn, especially the little boy; he is, I think, the flower of the flock-- a generous, noble-spirited boy, one to be led, but not driven, and remarkable for always speaking the truth.\" \"His sister Mary Ann will require watching,\" continued she, \"but she is a very good girl on the whole, though I wish her to be kept out of the nursery as much as possible, as she is now almost six years old, and might acquire bad habits from the nurses. I have ordered her bed to be placed in your room, and if you will be so kind as to look after her washing and dressing, and take charge of her clothes, she needs to have nothing further to do with the nursery maid.\" \n\nI replied I was quite willing to do so; and at that moment the children entered the room. Tom Bloomfield was a well-grown boy of seven. Mary was a tall girl, for her age of six, somewhat dark like her mother. The second sister was Fanny, a very pretty little girl, looking little younger than Mary. The remaining one was Harriet, a little broad, fat, merry, playful thing of scarcely two, whom I had more desire for than all the rest -- but with her I had nothing to do.\n\nQ: What time of year was it?\n\nA: not far past the middle of September\n\nQ: how was the weather?\n\nA: extremely cold\n\nQ: What time did they reach the destination?\n\nA: nearly one o'clock\n\nQ: What did she need to do first?\n\nA: enter the house\n\nQ: and then?\n\nA: introduce herself\n\nQ: What was she doing there?\n\nA: to teach her children\n\nQ: Who's children?\n\nA: Mrs. Bloomfield's\n\nQ: How many?\n\nA: four\n\nQ: Which was known for speaking the truth?\n\nA: Tom\n\nQ: Does the story tell you who the youngest was?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: who?\n\nA: Harriet\n\nQ: Who is six?\n\nA: Mary Ann\n\nQ: and seven?\n\nA: Tom\n\nQ: Whos bed is going to be in her room?\n\nA: Mary Ann\n\nQ: How old was this teacher?\n\nA: near nineteen\n\nQ: What held her attention on the meal?\n\nA: the toughness of the beefsteaks\n\nQ: Where did they dine?\n\nA: the dining-room\n\nQ: Who dined together?\n\nA: the girl, while Mrs. Bloomfield watched\n\nQ: HAs Mrs. Bloomfield been putting in a lot of time teaching the children?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: Does she think they are unwilling to learn?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Assistant: No, Mrs. Bloomfield does not think the children are unwilling to learn.

In 2015, 161,785 people resided on Guam. Guamanians are American citizens by birth. Guam has an area of 544 km2 (210 sq mi) and a density of 297/km² (770/sq mi). It is the largest and southernmost of the Mariana Islands, and the largest island in Micronesia. Among its municipalities, Mongmong-Toto-Maite has the highest density at 1,425/km² (3,691/sq mi), whereas Inarajan and Umatac have the lowest density at 47/km² (119/sq mi). The highest point is Mount Lamlam at 406 meters (1,332 ft) above sea level. \n\nThe Chamorros, Guam's indigenous people, settled the island approximately 4,000 years ago. Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan was the first European to visit the island on March 6, 1521. Guam was colonized in 1668 with settlers, like Diego Luis de San Vitores, a Catholic missionary. Between the 1500s and the 1700s, Guam was an important stopover for the Spanish Manila Galleons. During the Spanish–American War, the United States captured Guam on June 21, 1898.

Private detectives in modern-day Los Angeles, they're the stars of best-selling author Robert Crais' award-winning series of crime novels. Elvis and Joe have been busting bad guys and thrilling millions of readers since 1987's \"The Monkey's Raincoat.\" The books are international bestsellers, published in 42 countries, and have developed a fervent following. \n\nIn \"Taken,\" Crais's newest novel, his 15th featuring the daring duo, Elvis and Joe take on an especially bloodthirsty group of criminals called bajadores. They are bandits who prey on other bandits along the U.S.-Mexico border, dealing in drugs, murder and kidnapping. \n\n\"Taken\" is intense and fast-paced and reads like a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster.

I don't want to write the same book over and over again. I've done Elvis books; I've done Joe books; I've done mixed books, but this time, I made a conscious decision I wanted to tell a story where I could split the book pretty much down the middle and give them 50-50 equal footing so they both have their starring roles. When I discovered this particular story, it just seemed a perfect way to do that. Part of the book, they're working together. Then there's Elvis' track through the story, and there's Joe track, where he's trying to find Elvis and save him.

The development drove strong job and population growth, and low unemployment. However, falling oil prices have put pressure on state finances, leading to questions about the lack of diversity in the North Dakota economy and its vulnerability to commodity price swings. \n\nNorth Dakota is in the U.S. region known as the Great Plains.

In February, former Chicago Bears safety David Duerson shot himself in the chest, but not before leaving behind a note requesting his brain be studied for evidence of a disease striking football players. \n\nThe plaintive note read, \"Please, see that my brain is given to the NFL's brain bank.\" \n\nToday, scientists announced that Duerson's brain tissue showed \"moderately advanced\" evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a dementia-like brain disease afflicting athletes exposed to repeated brain trauma. \n\n\"Dave Duerson had classic pathology of CTE and no evidence of any other disease,\" said Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist with the Bedford VA Medical Center, and co-director of the Boston University School of Medicine Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. \"He had severe involvement of areas that control judgment, inhibition, impulse control, mood and memory.\" \n\nCTE has been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former NFL players thus far studied at the center. Their cases share a common thread -- repeated concussions, sub-concussive blows to the head, or both. The picture beginning to emerge from these cases is that trauma could be causing brain damage. \n\nA brain with CTE is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau. Under a microscope, tau appears as brown tangles that look similar to dementia. Except the cases of CTE have shown this progressive, dementia-like array in players well in advance of a typical dementia diagnosis, which typically occurs in the 70s or 80s. \n\nMike Webster, an offensive lineman with the Pittsburgh Steelers whose CTE was also diagnosed posthumously, was 50 when he died.

It was created on January 1, 1999, out of the former Lublin, Chełm, Zamość, Biała Podlaska and (partially) Tarnobrzeg and Siedlce Voivodeships, pursuant to Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. The province is named after its largest city and regional capital, Lublin, and its territory is made of four historical lands: the western part of the voivodeship, with Lublin itself, belongs to Lesser Poland, the eastern part of Lublin Area belongs to Red Ruthenia, and the northeast belongs to Polesie and Podlasie. \n\nLublin Voivodeship is bordered by Subcarpathian Voivodeship to the south, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship to the south-west, Masovian Voivodeship to the west and north, Podlaskie Voivodeship along a short boundary to the north, and Belarus and Ukraine to the east.

Provinces centred on Lublin have existed throughout much of Poland's history; for details see the section below on Previous Lublin Voivodeships. \n\nThe region was, before World War II, one of the world's leading centres of Judaism. Before the middle of the 16th century, there were few Jews in the area, concentrated in Lublin, Kazimierz Dolny, and perhaps Chełm; but the founding of new private towns led to a large movement of Jews into the region to develop trade and services. Since these new towns competed with the existing towns for business, there followed a low-intensity, long-lasting feeling of resentment, with failed attempts to limit the Jewish immigration. The Jews tended to settle mostly in the cities and towns, with only individual families setting up businesses in the rural regions; this urban/rural division became another factor feeding resentment of the newly arrived economic competitors. By the middle of the 18th century, Jews were a significant part of the population in Kraśnik, Lubartów and Łęczna.\n\nQ: What is the location that is the focus of the article?\n\nA: Lublin Voivodeship\n\nQ: What is on its northern border?\n\nA: Podlaskie Voivodeship\n\nQ: What is to its east?\n\nA: Belarus and Ukraine\n\nQ: To its northwest?\n\nA: Masovian Voivodeship\n\nQ: To the southwest?\n\nA: Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship\n\nQ: How about to the south?\n\nA: Subcarpathian Voivodeship\n\nQ: What country is it in?\n\nA: Poland\n\nQ: When was it formed?\n\nA: 1999\n\nQ: From which previous entities?\n\nA: out of the former Lublin, Chełm, Zamość, Biała Podlaska and (partially) Tarnobrzeg and Siedlce Voivodeships\n\nQ: What is its  name derived from?\n\nA: after its largest city and regional capital\n\nQ: Who does the western portion belong to?\n\nA: Lesser Poland\n\nQ: The northeast part?\n\nA: Polesie and Podlasie\n\nQ: The eastern part?\n\nA: Red Ruthenia\n\nQ: How many people live in the area?\n\nA: 2,175,251\n\nQ: As of what year?\n\nA: 2006\n\nQ: What religion did it used to be an important location for?\n\nA: one of the world's leading centres of Judaism\n\nQ: Since when?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: What is the location that is the focus of the article?\n\nA: Lublin Voivodeship\n"}

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nBuenos Aires ( or ; ) is the capital and most populous city of Argentina. The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. \"Buenos aires\" can be translated as \"fair winds\" or \"good airs\", but the first one was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name \"Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre\". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million. \n\nThe city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's capital; rather, it is an autonomous district. In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province. The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the city. The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name: Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires (Autonomous City of Buenos Aires). Its citizens first elected a chief of government (i.e. mayor) in 1996; previously, the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic.\n\nQ: What does buenos aires mean?\n\nA: \"fair

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\n(CNN) -- More Arizona and New Mexico residents Wednesday returned to their homes, in some cases to find them intact, in other cases to sift through debris left by a massive wildfire. \n\nThe Wallow fire in east central Arizona is one of 58 large wildfires burning in the United States, from Alaska to Florida, according to the National Interagency Coordination Center. All told, the fires have burned 2,166 square miles or 1.4 million acres -- nearly the size of Delaware. \n\nThe largest of the fires continues to be Arizona's Wallow fire, which has burned 529,825 acres so far, the fire's incident command team announced Wednesday. Officials said it is about 58% contained. \n\nWhile residents in Greer, Arizona, and Luna, New Mexico, have been allowed home, evacuation orders remain in effect in other locations.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nA psychological identity relates to self-image (one's mental model of oneself), self-esteem, and individuality. Consequently, Weinreich gives the definition \"A person's identity is defined as the totality of one's self-construal, in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future\"; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity, such as: \"One's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one's construal of past ancestry and one's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity\" (Weinreich, 1986a). \n\nThe description or representation of individual and group identity is a central task for psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists and those of other disciplines where \"identity\" needs to be mapped and defined. How should one describe the identity of another, in ways which encompass both their idiosyncratic qualities and their group memberships or identifications, both of which can shift according to circumstance? Following on from the work of Kelly, Erikson, Tajfel and others Weinreich's Identity Structure Analysis (ISA), is \"a structural representation of the individual's existential experience, in which the relationships between self and other agents are organised in relatively stable structures over time … with the emphasis on the socio-cultural milieu in which self relates to other agents and institutions\" (Weinreich and Saunderson, (eds) 2003, p1). Using constructs drawn from the salient discourses of the individual, the group and cultural norms, the practical operationalisation of ISA provides a methodology that maps how these are used by the individual, applied across time and milieus by the \"situated self\" to appraise self and other agents and institutions (for example, resulting in the individual's evaluation of self and significant others and institutions).[citation needed]\n\nQ: What is the ISA?\n\nA: Identity Structure Analysis (ISA)\n\nQ: Who started it?\n\nA: Weinreich\n\nQ: What was the date of his quote?\n\nA: 1986\n\nQ: Who collaborated with him?\n\nA: Saunderson\n\nQ: In what year?\n\nA: 2003\n\nQ: What did they emphasize?\n\nA: the socio-cultural milieu\n\nQ: In relation to what?\n\nA: in which self relates to other agents and institutions\n\nQ: Where did the constraints come from?\n\nA: from the salient discourses of the individual, the group and cultural norms,\n\nQ: What is mapped?\n\nA: \"identity\"\n\nQ: What example is given?\n\nA: esulting in the individual's evaluation of self and significant others and institutions\n\nQ: Was there a citation for this?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: What is the ISA?\n\nA: Identity Structure Analysis (ISA)\n"}

He believes they planted a magazine with a drawing in a cabin to make it look like the \"wild man\" was responsible for blowing up a hotel.\n\n2. **Roger's Defense**: Roger claims he found the magazine with the drawing on a shelf in the cabin where the \"wild man\" was staying. He insists the evidence is genuine.\n\n3. **Dave's Support**: Dave backs up Roger, stating that they can prove the \"wild man\" was near the dynamite storage and was seen in Oakdale multiple times.\n\n4. **Doctor Clay's Role**: Doctor Clay is involved in the situation, likely as a mediator or investigator, and is being informed of the accusations and defenses.\n\n5. **The \"Wild Man\"**: This character is central to the plot, accused of blowing up the hotel, but the true motives and actions of others are being questioned.\n\nIf you have specific questions or need further clarification about the story, feel free to ask!"}

For Hindus, Diwli is very important and it is also very exciting time for them. Normally , this holiday is celebrated in October or November and it falls on a different date each year. This year , it will be celebrated on October23. Diwali is usually celebrated for 5 days. To prepare for Diwali, Hindus spend several weeks cleaning their homes and preparing special food in order to welcome Laskhmi, the goodness of wealth into their lives. They will open the windows of their homes during this time to make sure that she can enter their home. One of other traditions of Dawali is to light up oil lamp in the homes. The oil lamps are used to make the goddess of wealth enter the homes. Hindus believe that she will not enter a home that is not lit up. During Diwali, the children in India do not have to go to school. They share gifts with one another and prepare special holiday meals to celebrate this event. Fireworks are also a big part of the Diwali festival. They are used to scare away bad spirits.\n\nQ: How do people get ready for Diwali?\n\nA: Cleaning their homes and preparing special food\n\nQ: What is Diwali?\n\nA: the Festival of Lights\n\nQ: Where is it celebrated?\n\nA: in India\n\nQ: By who?\n\nA: by Hindus\n\nQ: For how long?\n\nA: 5 days\n\nQ: How long do they take to get ready?\n\nA: several weeks\n\nQ: Who are they expecting?\n\nA: Laskhmi\n\nQ: Who is she?\n\nA: the goddess of wealth\n\nQ: How will she get in?\n\nA: the windows\n\nQ: What happens if they house is dark?\n\nA: she will not enter\n\nQ: What do they use for light?\n\nA: oil lamps\n\nQ: Is the festival always the same day?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: The same month?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: What months does it usually take place?\n\nA: in October or November\n\nQ: What day is it this year?\n\nA: October23\n\nQ: What is used to keep bad spirits away?\n\nA: Fireworks\n\nQ: Do the kids get time off of school?\n\nA: Yes\n\nQ: What do they make for the event?\n\nA: special holiday meals\n\nQ: Do they share anything?\n\nA: gifts\n\nQ: With who?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: How do people get ready for Diwali?\n\nA: Cleaning their homes and preparing special food\n"}

Writing in \"Nature\" in 1961, William Astbury described molecular biology as: \n\nResearchers in molecular biology use specific techniques native to molecular biology but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas from genetics and biochemistry. There is not a defined line between these disciplines. The figure to the right is a schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationships between the fields: \n\nMuch of molecular biology is quantitative, and recently much work has been done at its interface with computer science in bioinformatics and computational biology. In the early 2000s, the study of gene structure and function, molecular genetics, has been among the most prominent sub-fields of molecular biology. Increasingly many other areas of biology focus on molecules, either directly studying interactions in their own right such as in cell biology and developmental biology, or indirectly, where molecular techniques are used to infer historical attributes of populations or species, as in fields in evolutionary biology such as population genetics and phylogenetics.

{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nThree little kids lived in a great big house with a great big cat and many places for a great big cat to hide. Their great big cat was named Cowboy. And Cowboy was not a very nice cat. Cowboy liked to bite and chew and scratch a great many things. When Cowboy was happy, which was not very often, Cowboy liked to bite in to a blanket or soft toy and carry it around in his mouth. When Cowboy was hungry he liked to bite bright red tomatoes and suck out all the juice and seeds. And when Cowboy was feeling mean he liked to hide. Cowboy would hide, curled up tight in a ball under a blanket or behind a corner and wait for one of the little kids to pass by. When they did pass by Cowboy would jump at their feet and try to bite and scratch them. He did not know that what he was doing was not very nice. Cowboy was only a cat. A great big cat that did not know any better.\n\nQ: What kind of pet did the kids have?\n\nA: cat\n\nQ: What type of food the did cat like to eat?\n\nA: tomatoes\n\nQ: What was the cat's name?\n\nA: Cowboy.\n\nQ: What did Cowboy do with the juice of the tomatoes?\n\nA: sucked it\n\nQ: And what about the seed?\n\nA: yes\n\nQ: Where did Cowboy hide?\n\nA: under a blanket or behind a corner\n\nQ: Why was he hiding?\n\nA: to wait for one of the little kids to pass by\n\nQ: Whose feet the the animal jump at?\n\nA: little kids\n\nQ: Why did he do that?\n\nA: to try to bite and scratch them\n\nQ: Why did he want to bite and scratch them?\n\nA: he was feeling mean\n\nQ: Did he realize he was being mean?\n\nA: no\n\nQ: Why not?\n\nA: he was only a cat\n\nQ: What did he want to chew on?\n\nA: a blanket\n\nQ: What else?\n\nA: a soft toy\n\nQ: How did he transport the toy?\n\nA:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n", "output": "Q: What kind of pet did the kids have?\n\nA: cat\n"}
{"input": "<|im_start|>user\nYears ago, when I started looking for my first job, wise advisers advised, \"Barbara, be enthusiastic ! Enthusiasm will take you further than any amount of experience.\" How right they were! \n\n\"Nothing great was ever done without enthusiasm,\" wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson. It is the paste that helps you hang in there when the things get tough. It is the inner voice that tells you, \"I can do it!\" when others shout, \"No, you can't!\" It took years and years for the early work of Barbara McClintock, a geneticist who won the 1983 Nobel Prize in medicine, to be generally accepted. Yet she didn't stop working on her experiments. \n\nWe are all born with wide-eyed, enthusiastic wonder and it is the childlike wonder that gives enthusiastic people such youthful air, whatever their age. At 90, cellist Pablo Casals would start his day by playing the cello . As the music flowed through his fingers, his shoulders would straighten and joy would reappear in his eyes. As writer and poet Samuel Ullman once worte, \"Years wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.\" \n\nEnthusiastic people also love what they do, not considering money or title or power. Patricia Mellratl, a retired director of the Missouri Rpertory Theater in Kansas City, was once asked where she got her enthusiasm.

Here's a more structured version of your summary and answers:\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYears ago, when I began my job search, wise advisers told me, \"Be enthusiastic! Enthusiasm will take you further than any amount of experience.\" They were right. Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, \"Nothing great was ever done without enthusiasm.\" Enthusiasm is the driving force that helps us persevere through tough times and the inner voice that tells us, \"I can do it!\" when others doubt us.\n\nBarbara McClintock, a geneticist who won the 1983 Nobel Prize in Medicine, is a prime example. Her groundbreaking work took years to be widely accepted, but she never stopped experimenting. Enthusiasm is a childlike wonder that gives people a youthful spirit, regardless of their age. At 90, cellist Pablo Casals would start his day by playing the cello, and his joy was evident in his eyes. Samuel Ullman once said, \"Years wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.\"\n\nEnthusiastic people love what they do, not for money, title, or power. Patricia Mellratl, a retired director of the Missouri Repertory Theater, once shared that her father told her, \"I never made any money until I stopped working for it.\" We should not waste time on regrets but turn our tears into sweat as we pursue what can be. We should live each moment wholeheartedly, finding joy in simple pleasures like a backyard garden, a child's smile, or a rainbow.\n\n---\n\n**Answers to Questions:**\n\n1. **When did the woman win the award?**  \n   1983  \n\n2. **What award was it?**  \n   Nobel Prize in Medicine  \n\n3. **What was her job?**  \n   Geneticist  \n\n4. **How long did it take her to get there?**  \n   Years and years  \n\n5. **What was her name?**  \n   Barbara McClintock  \n\n6. **Who was the musician?**  \n   Pablo Casals  \n\n7. **Is he old?**  \n   Yes, he was 90  \n\n8. **What does he play?**  \n   Cello  \n\n9. **Who works at the theater?**  \n   Patricia Mellratl  \n\n10. **Is she still working?**  \n    No, she is retired  \n\n11. **Where did she work?**  \n    Missouri Repertory Theater  \n\n12. **What was her position there?**  \n    Director  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like further assistance!"}
